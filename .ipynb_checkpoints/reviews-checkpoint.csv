Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They need to build stronger aircraft or…,C L,"Monday, January 22, 2024 at 11:36:05 PM","Date of experience: January 21, 2024","They need to build stronger aircraft or something, because the amount of times my flight was canceled and/or delayed for my trip from Dublin to Glasgow was ridiculous. On top of that, their phone service for re-booking was downright awful BS. Workers were hanging up, not giving me correct info, all kinds of crap. Never again with this airline",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.aerlingus.com
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Avoid!! get insulted with customer service,Senhao Zhang,"Sunday, January 21, 2024 at 11:12:17 PM","Date of experience: January 21, 2024","The guy who picked up my was so rude and even insult me with my name provided, last word says that your name clearly not from this destination country and you should go back to your home then hang up. I am going to report this incident to the Irish government. HOW COME A COUNTRY WHO HAS BEEN SUFFERED FOR 800 YEARS STILL DISCRIMINATING OTHERS? TRULY DO NOT UNDERSTAND, AND I AM NOT EVENING GOING TO IRELAND! GOOD JOB AER LINGUS",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.aerlingus.com
Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Cancelled flight,John Mc.,"Thursday, January 25, 2024 at 12:52:51 AM","Date of experience: January 07, 2024","I recently had a flight cancellation due to fog where all airlines were cancelling most flights. I waited in the airport for 5.5hrs before being told the flight was cancelled. Not sure why an Aer Lingus flight to the same destination as ours managed to depart, scheduled 1.5hrs after ours? You may think why the 4stars? I managed to get through quickly to AL rebooked a flight for the next day. They said to book a hotel, meals & transport would be covered too. (Nb; 2 different AL personnel advised us that there were no limits on expense claims for hotel/meals/transport, this was incorrect. It is £250 max) I submitted my receipts a few days after getting home. AL confirmed the receipts and stated I would get £240 back. This was in my account within 7 working days! Hence the 4-stars. This type of quick resolution rarely happens with big companies so well done AL!",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.aerlingus.com

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible customer service.,Paul,"Friday, January 19, 2024 at 08:16:42 PM","Date of experience: January 15, 2024","Refund not issued in agreed time.

Complaint has been ignored.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely appalling,Lisa Rose,"Wednesday, January 24, 2024 at 10:10:49 PM","Date of experience: December 21, 2023","Absolutely appalling - On the 21st December when I logged on to check my son travelling from Salt Lake home, I discovered that his booking had been cancelled. I rang customer service immediately and they said that it had been cancelled, it turns out that a third party who could not possibly have passed the initial security questions was somehow able to ring them and cancel my son's flight. I cannot understand how this could have possibly happened. Customer service were extremely unhelpful and told me that I would have to file a complaint and purchase another ticket for him. As it was Christmas and I felt I had no other option, I booked him on the exact same flights home and had to pay an extra £400 for the privilege and the flights were already extremely expensive given the time of year. On the evening of the 21st I received an email saying they would refund me the flight price and I wrote back to say great, I would also like to received the additional £400 I had to spend. I have heard absolutely nothing from them since. I have rung, whatsapp messaged and telephoned, in total 11 times and I am consistently told that my case has been referred to ""the relevant department"", and it seems I am not allowed to speak with them or contact ""the relevant department"" in any way. I am absolutely appalled with the situation. I literally spend thousands a year with the airline. In future I will give my money to a better company.",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.aerlingus.com

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,do not use,Aimee Carter,"Thursday, January 11, 2024 at 12:42:56 AM","Date of experience: January 07, 2024","booked return flights to Belfast for a weekend away, my return flight ended up being cancelled and I was told that someone would be in touch to let me know next steps - this never happened. I was emailed a new boarding pass for a full 24 hours later. When I asked about claiming a hotel back they said this wasn't possible, I also couldn't claim back any expenses for going to another airport or getting another flight. Absolutely disgusting, there is a page on the website for claiming travel expenses back for cancelled flight so I'm not even sure why they bother offering this when they won't pay anything back. All in all cost me an extra £250 to get home.

Tried phoning them but the guy on the phone kept putting me on hold for 10 minutes at a time and then offered no solution other than to go online and read their FAQ's - useless.

I would never ever use them again!",https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.aerlingus.com
