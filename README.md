## Introduction 📢
Word of Mouth (WOM) significantly influences consumer choices, with 92% of consumers trusting recommendations from friends and family over other forms of advertising. In the airline industry, electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM) has become crucial due to the intangible nature of services offered. This project aims to develop a text classification model to predict whether an airline review is from a promoter 👍, detractor 👎, or passive customer 😐, enabling airlines to enhance their marketing strategies and customer loyalty.

- **Impact of eWOM:** eWOM extends beyond face-to-face interactions, having a broader and lasting impact on consumer decisions.
- **Customer Behavior:** 96% of customers seek out negative reviews, but positive reviews can lead to a 5-9% increase in business revenue.
- **Airline Industry:** Online reviews are heavily relied upon for assessing safety, price, and service quality. Negative perceptions, especially related to safety, significantly impact decision-making.

## Objectives 🎯
- **Develop a High-Performing Classification Model:** Accurately classify reviews as promoters 👍, passives 😐, or detractors 👎.
- **Data Visualization and Insights:** Analyze patterns and trends to refine data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **Experimentation with Different Models:** Test various machine learning algorithms to find the most effective one.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Aim for a high recall score to prioritize the correct identification of detractors, mitigating negative impacts and enhancing customer satisfaction.
