✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Miami,December 2023,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,3.0,2,no,2," Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. ",british airways

I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special.

I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids.",british airways
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Dusseldorf (DUS) to Miami (MIA) ,January 2024,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us.",british airways

I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property.

Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart.

No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.,british airways

Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention.",british airways

The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company.

Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu).",british airways

The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin).

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Gatwick to St Lucia,December 2023,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,2,"  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice.",british airways
Not Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to London Heathrow,December 2023,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,3,no,5," This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Lisbon to Houston via London Heathrow,November 2023,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,3," Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain.",british airways

Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again.",british airways

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Mumbai via London Heathrow ,December 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service.",british airways

We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money!

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gran Canaria  to London Gatwick,December 2023,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,3.0,5,yes,6,"  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!",british airways

On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed.

I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa.

I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever.",british airways
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow ,December 2023,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,4,yes,8," Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes.",british airways
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to Manchester via Heathrow,December 2023,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. ",british airways

Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there.",british airways

Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Las Palmas,December 2023,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,yes,9,"   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all.",british airways

But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings).

I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me.",british airways

I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest.",british airways
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Zürich to Tokyo Haneda via London,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert",british airways

So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing.",british airways

They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet.",british airways

There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier. Our original ticket (and the return flight a week later) included a checked bag. When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesn't included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them. We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did- but not this one! They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight. So we had no choice but to pay up, thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund. 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny. Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond!  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system, compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim, and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months.",british airways

Two weeks without a change of clothes or her CPAP machine. Contacting customer service was a nightmare. We never talked to a real person. Very little effort was put into getting them their bags. In one port we were on the ship and the bags were at the airport. The airlines did not deliver the bags nor did they tell our friends that they needed to go get them. The airline couldn’t be bothered to take the bags from the airport to the ship. BA says it is their policy to get you your bags within 72 hours. That is a joke!

Flight was delayed from Bucharest because of ATC strike. Arrived at Heathrow 40 minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow). I missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me I had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day. There was just a shameful 10£ food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at LHR. No accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport. I asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry, but they will not compensate anything.

I was informed of this prior to departure so could amend. Bag drop at MAN T3 wasn't smooth but I suspect that was MAN fault. Shuttle boarding was slow and delayed meaning a rush at LHR T5. The flight to CPT was full but we left more or less on time. The cabin was clean and PE was what we expected, sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perks with drinks. Only complaint is the seats actually recline too far. Staff were very good during the first few hours of service, especially George. Food was quite tasty but one option wasn't loaded. Breakfast was also quite tasty and we landed on time. The fly in the ointment is both our cases arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into, likely at CPT.

With some reassurance and comfort of service, quality, luggage allowance etc. In fact I’ve never flown with the budget airlines. My most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am I actually getting for my money and is BA what they once were. While the flights were around an hour delayed both ways, the cabin and ground staff service were ok. It is the facilities (or lack of) that I am most disappointed by. The flight was Approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake. In fact on my return journey I wasn’t even offered the water! To top it off BA no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away. There wasn’t even the obligatory flight journey. The WiFi was poor. I couldn’t even access the shop. However, for a fee so much more was available. This explains BAs record profit of £1.52bn. So, the question is, what am I paying for? I will now for sure opt for the budget airlines. They are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for, which I can decide to choose or not.

We had to spend $100 in cab fare to Barcelona because the Bacelona ground crew (Iberia) claimed they had delivered it to us. 7. Heathrow ground crew made us 15 minutes late arriving back into Heathrow after our cruise. We actually landed 10 minutes early, but those incompetent people still were not ready for us. 8. The Heathrow ground crew caused us to leave 45 minutes late even though ALL passengers were boarded and ready 15 minutes before the departure time. This will probably mean we will miss our connection in Anchorage. BA clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground base...shameful. BA is a joke and should be embarrassed they can't operate like a normal airline.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Gibraltar,October 2023,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,3.0,2,no,6,"  London Heathrow to Gibraltar on 24th October 2023. I shall start by reference to the booking process. I used the BA website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect. The flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand. When boarding the flight the cabin-crew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called “budget” rivals. On this route BA have a monopoly and so I did not have an option to use the services of a different company.",british airways

Being only 1.73 m tall I have no problem with legroom in the back of the plane, the seat was OK if getting a little numbing after 5 hours, and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome. However, it must be said that the value for money was poor: with a checked bag on the return leg only, this was a nearly £700 ticket. And although I am content to pass the time by reading or sleeping, it was surprising to find no in-flight entertainment on 5-hour flights.

That flight was 1.5 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto. Because we missed the connection (their fault), they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport, they booked us a new return flight, then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto.

BA somehow experience cancellations and delays most of the time. Second, the in-flight service is usually weak. Food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests. The screens in the A380s should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as A321s. Especially in longer flights, the entertainment system becomes more important. There is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket. I would expect more from BA. If you are flying from the US to anywhere except the UK, I would recommend considering other airlines. But if you are flying to/from UK directly, then BA could be one of your choices.",british airways

For more than half of the flight a child was watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in - it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as I could hear it above my headphones. Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down. Why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class? Has this airline turned into a zoo? Are staff given no training in customer service? Why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers? When I told the staff she just laughed at me. BA customer service is a disgrace.

Every year the service gets worse. I brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section. 25½ inches. BA has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft. Thankfully I'm not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable. When BA first started flying out of Austin, the food was great. Now, when I arrive at Heathrow, I get real food and take it on the plane with me. I don't know where or who makes BA's food, but it is not eatable. If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London, I would fly with a different airline. When we checked into Heathrow, the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter. I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic, but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits.",british airways

The plane was very full, and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding, making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised. Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays (and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow). Onboard service was ok but minimal  - BA gave up being a full-service airline some time ago. More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was non-existent.

This had been advised by BA shortly after booking, with the option to change flights if we preferred. Although the business class cabin was of a similar layout to BA Club Europe, i.e. with the middle seat kept free, my wife and I felt the seats were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better. Service was good on board and the meal was very tasty (we chose the beef cheeks). All was good until we landed at Heathrow! Although we passed through passport control without delay, once we were at the designated baggage reclaim, we just waited and waited! After an hour and ten minutes I went to the BA baggage counter to ask what was going on. They seemed unaware of an issue, but said they would find out! Over the next hour or so various other passengers also requested information and despite various announcements and a list of different excuses it was almost 2½ hours before the bags finally arrived. Frustrating to say the least. I subsequently complained to BA, but after 4 weeks there has been no explanation just the automated message from customer services ‘we are experiencing exceptionally high volumes’.

They just don’t care. Long waits to speak to anybody, who then have no power to actually solve anything, and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway. If the flights are cancelled (as were my original ones) you’re really left on your own and nobody cares. The onboard services are so-so but for short haul it’s now “semi-low cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect. This time we were given a bottle of water and a (very) small snack, whilst anything else had to be paid for. And yet on some other flights apparently you have to pre-order any additional food. It’s confusing, which makes it not dependable. Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins, leading to long boarding delays. Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well . The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight (contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off ) so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place. Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them. I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline.",british airways

Having noted the ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg, which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its ""Business Class"" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Short-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etc. places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines, such as Qatar, Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers - really? I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name ""Budget Airways"" The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care/appreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip. Both flights were around 4 hours in duration, on the same day. Guess which one is shows BA's in-flight offering!",british airways

Took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights. On boarding at Gatwick, realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving. Apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason. The crew said there was nothing they could do (although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats). We were told to claim a refund on return home. We did this via a complaint form Ns BA offered us £100 in vouchers. We didn't accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money back.

The difference between business class and premium economy (which I never fly) is $3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is $6500 AUD. They owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds. The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them - I need to lie down. The wait for them to get around to me has been numbing. The insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation.

Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board, only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasn't allowed yet. The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious. The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company. Service was slow, and as usual, choices of food to purchase ran out before they'd reached row 24. I requested a cup of tea which never appeared. Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels. The over officious senior flight attendant, who'd been facilitating in 'Club Europe' appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests (whilst still in mid flight) making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse.

As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste.

The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year.

When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked.

We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight.

Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well.

I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst. It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff. My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time.,british airways

After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone. I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information",british airways

Before booking with anyone I thought Aeromexico would probably be the best for customer service. Big mistake! Our trip was 19 days away and well we were super excited because we were going to see my husband's sister and our nephew who is one. I shouldn't say excited but we were finally going to see him because he is very sick from cancer and they don't think he will make it to his second birthday. Anyways, I always have a habit of checking on international airlines because they always change the time or date. I couldn't check because it said I didn't have a confirmation number or flight number. We had two stops before getting to our destination so I had to call Delta first. Delta said Aeromexico cancelled our flight. I then called Aeromexico and they said I called and spoke Spanish to cancel our trip and get a refund, mind you I always ask to speak to someone in English because my Spanish isn't to great. Then I ask to speak to a supervisor and they said none were available. Next day I called to speak to a supervisor and a agent was going to investigate what happened. He than calls me again the next day and says that I sent them an email asking for a cancellation and refund, another lie! I ask for someone higher than him because this was upsetting already. Still no one. The next day he calls me back and says, it wasn't me who sent the email but my 17 year old daughter. Another lie! I think they just went down our itinerary and picked a name to blame. Our dog was supposed to go with us because I couldn't leave her here for so long. I paid almost $400 dollars for her. They said they don't refund pet fees and airline fee etc. I lost almost 1,000 dollars because of Aeromexico. I had to cancel our Airbnb and they didn't give us our money back.

In my personal experience, this airline has demonstrated a lack of professionalism and reliability. One of the major issues I encountered is their frequent changes in flight areas without providing sufficient means for passengers to stay informed. The availability of screens displaying these changes is limited, and there is a notable absence of announcements in English or bilingual employees to assist non-Spanish speakers. During my journey, which involved a stopover in Mexico City on both the outbound and return flights, I encountered a distressing situation involving my 87-year-old grandmother. Aeromexico staff separated her from the rest of our party, despite the presence of completely vacant seats on one of the flights where we could have easily been accommodated together. When we approached the employees for assistance, they claimed there was nothing they could do, leaving us feeling frustrated and disappointed. Regrettably, the most appalling customer service experience occurred on our return journey, as well as on our way to our destination. All members of our travel group contracted a parasite during our trip. As we were boarding the flight, the airline initially announced that they would wait for a passenger in the bathroom, only to abruptly change their decision and close the doors, leaving us behind. It is common for groups traveling together to prefer not to leave anyone behind, and this unexpected action forced us to endure a gruelling 12-hour wait at the airport. Even after spending approximately $580 per person for the return trip, we encountered further rudeness from the Aeromexico staff during security procedures. Considering the involvement of three countries in our travels, one would expect a certain level of customer service, but unfortunately, Aeromexico failed to meet even the most basic standards.

The following day I flew to PVR in economy class because business class was full. Arrived in PVR but my luggage did not. It arrived 2 days later. My review is not about the delays but the bad service of Aeromexico crew and ground service. Aeromexico flight attendants are cut and dry sort of unfriendly. They are not rude but they seem that they are not happy doing what they do. During the flight, some of the pursers talk too much. I like to have 1J seat and I constantly hear they chit chatting among themselves. Another annoying factor is that as a typical Mexican Airline, they love sponsors.  Ground personal, are the worst. They seem all so unhappy that I try to do my check in at home and not face them. Watch out, if you have a problem, then you are in trouble. Seldom they find solutions but try to make it more difficult for you.  If you are going to connect in Mexico City Airport, do yourself a favor, choose the fastest connecting flight, I think it is one of the worst airports I have been and don´t rely on Aeromexico Lounge. It is a lounge for anyone that pays a fee to get in. It is uncomfortable, crowed, noise and there is seldom any food to eat. If you are a frequent flyer with AM, you probably already realized that their mileage programe is a hoax. If you want to exchange for a business class ticket they ask in a R/T trip in some cases almost 1 million points. In economy if you are luck with 300,000 points. Do you know how long you will take to accrue that many miles? Aeromexico rips you off and gives bad service.

All of that was inconvenient, but within the realm of airline travel in our times. The real issue was the return. I checked in online, had my boarding passes, arrived on time and was ready to board.

They have a horrible customer service experience. We called them regarding our flights being canceled and they refused to give us other options. They also refused to give us a refund. When they refused to give us a refund, we asked for a future credit, which they also denied. I will never book any flights through AeroMexico as they don't try to work with you in any shape or form for any cancellations or reschedules, even when things were on their end to fix. For us, our flight got cancelled due to volcanic activity in Mexico City, which I understood it was out of everyone's control. But the fact that they were unwilling to give us a credit / refund / alternative flight it's just outrageous. They essentially just kept the money. Please do yourself a favor and never book through them. Not worth the fight.",Aeromexico

Apart from the fact that Aeromexico lost my luggage (then LATAM recovered it), I had to wait in line for literally 6 hours so I could ask ""where's my bag?"". Other people waited for much longer than 6 hours, I was a lucky one. The, when I finally got my turn in line the woman tells me it's not their fault and that I have to look for my luggage again elsewhere or talk to LATAM (which was responsible for my next flight). That weekend while other companies were also having trouble because of some unfortunate climate events, Aeromexico was the only company which made people wait for more than 30 hours so they could take off.  Their website is trash. Their app is trash. And based on other's reviews it seems they don't invest enough in tech so they can offer a better and more automated service. Not to mention the fact that they offer flights in international airports and when you ask their staff if they speak english they just shake their head and turn their backs for you.

We were left stranded in Guadalajara for the night without any meal vouchers or hotel accommodation. I had to pay for a hotel and taxi out of pocket. So many people in the airport were left stranded and Aeromexico staff were not helpful at all. They were giving so many mis-information. I called to submit a claim for reimbursement for the hotel and taxi and they keep giving me the run-around and just keep telling me it's not their responsibility. I have had similar delay experiences with British Airways and American Airlines in the past, but these airlines have at least reimbursed me for costs incurred because of the delay OR at the very least provided free accommodations.",Aeromexico

We assumed everything was fine as all of us continued to receive emails regarding our trip home with Aeromexico, we were even able to check in for our flights online. Little did we know, because we had decided to miss that connection in Mexico City, Aeromexico decided to cancel all of our return trips with no notice. We found this out because a friend of ours had left a day early and gave us a heads up so we called the airline. They were able to reactivate some of our tickets but 3 of our friends were forced to pay another $1200 to buy seats on the same flight back that they initially had.

The staff was amazing - professional, courteous, and very friendly (and still are with the obvious exceptions (mentioned below). Unfortunately, our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with, a disability, you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues (health, age, children, etc) need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. It's not meant to be a free-for-all. Well, not unless you board your Aeromexico (AM) flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport, NLU (Santa Lucia). NLU is a relatively brand new airport (opened March 2022) and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos, we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee, etc, and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized, it wasn't the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight, NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board, there were no zones or even basic pre-boarding. AM had a group of 20-30 who appeared to be traveling together (not young, disabled, etc) who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding -- one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope, it was a cluster eff free-for-all. Oh, silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76-year-old amputee husband need the special boarding, but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didn't get it. So, we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby had problems with his carry-on (which had his meds) and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand, I realize that space is limited on flights, but if you pay for certain benefits, you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand ""too bad, so sad"" letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course, that's not going to happen. No, I wasn't looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says, ""we ate the steak.""

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sao Paulo to Mexico City,November 2022,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4,no,2,"  Traveled in business on three Aeromexico flights on this trip AMS-MEX-GRU-MEX. Overall a fair to poor experience. The biggest positive is the seat is quite comfortable, and that's important. The negatives include an absolute horror show at Mexico City Airport T2 (and an even worse transit to T1). Nothing is particularly easy or smooth and Aeromexico does little to nothing to help ease transiting passengers through the madness. The lounges are third rate and overcrowded. As a result ended up finding a few cafes in the terminal which were far superior than the lounges. The really surprising negative were the Aeromexico business class cabin crews. While efficient in serving meals and performing basic tasks, not one crew had warm, friendly people that either welcomed you or smiled. They come across as some combination of angry and arrogant. It's surprising to me because it's not reflective of Mexico itself, which has some of the warmest, kindest people on earth. Not sure where they find these crews or how they train them but they don't do a particularly good job.",Aeromexico

Our fright from PV departed late and then when we landed in Mex City our plane was unable to gate for about 15 mins. When we finally got out of the plane at 17:43 we raced to our connecting flight which is supposed to depart 18:05. We got there at 17:55 and were denied boarding. They sent us to customer service that got us on the next flight at 23:55. We paid for upgraded seats because I’m a tall guy and we did not get them on the later flight due to availability. When we called the airline customer service for a refund for the upgrades they told us to contact the customer service email and promptly hung up on us. We called back and spoke with another representative and she informed us we would indeed have to email customer service. We did email them, but got a prompt email back basically telling us there is nothing they can do refund us. Now that I’ve read reviews for this airline I see it’s a common problem. I will be doing a charge back on my Mastercard when the payment is processed.",Aeromexico
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Sacramento to Cancun,",October 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I suggest you fly with another airline if you speak English! They are not fluent in English. The customer service is poor. They cancelled our flight because we could not accept the changes they made, which was a 24 hour layover. They would not refund our money, and tried to charge us $1,200 more dollars for another flight. I hear that they continuously have layover issues. Several people were late to our resort for a wedding due to this airline. They will not accommodate you in any way if you have car trouble and miss your flight. They will not give you a standby flight! They expect you to pay for another flight. Please be wary of this airline! It would be better to spend a little more money, and get better customer service, and know that you would be accommodated fairly if there were issues, which are sometimes inevitable.",Aeromexico
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Austin to Lima via Mexico City,July 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I did not make this trip because Aeromexico does not have bad customer services, they have no customer service. I booked Austin to Lima roundtrip in first class for my husband and I. Approximately 3 months before our trip, I began receiving e-mails with changes to my itinerary ... significant changes which ultimately resulted in 2 extra legs to the trip and removal from first class for all travel except Mexico City to Lima. I have an extensive record of my efforts to speak to someone to address these unacceptable changes - e-mails, calls, Facebook chats - for 2 months and never spoke to anyone who could do anything except give me a different e-mail address to submit my problem to. Thus the extensive record using multiple e-mail addresses provided to me by Aeromexico staff. This itinerary was impossible for my elderly husband - changing planes 4 times, taking an entire day of travel, and riding in coach (after paying for first class) was beyond his capabilities. Ultimately, we had to relinquish our trip - continued to seek some kind of compensation, and have yet to speak to a single person who had any authority to assist us before or since the date of our travels. I will never use this airline for any trip ever again.",Aeromexico
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tijuana to Puerto Vallarta via Mexico City,October 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  
This review is about the ticket purchase. On September 30, 2022, I purchased a ticket from Aeromexico, in my partners name to fly from Tijuana to Puerto Vallarta. The ticket price was $169.04. I paid with my Capital One credit card, but the transaction was held because my bank questioned the charge. I responded to the bank immediately and the charge went through. All this within 10 minutes or so.. I then received an e-mail confirming that the flight was booked and he was ready to fly. Great, no problem. In the meantime Alejandro got the notice that it was time to check in. When he attempted to check in on line he was unable to do so, and instead was notified that he had to see a gate agent. On Monday October 24, Alejandro got to the airport and went to the ticket counter where he was told that the ticket had not been paid, and he’d have to pay about $436.00 for a new ticket. Not having any other recourse, and needing to get home, he reluctantly paid the exhorbitant amount that Aeromexico required. The next day, he called Aeromexico and told then that the money had been originally paid for the ticket and that he wanted a refund of the more than $400.00 that he was forced into paying. Their response was to offer to refund the $169.04 that was the original cost of the ticket. Note that offering that, indicates that they know they were paid originally and they knew how much. It’s hard to think that this is not a scam, but it is highly unusual that an airline would release the ticket and then turn around and claim it was never paid. ",Aeromexico

On top of that my final destination flight were cancelled permanently, I had no way of getting to the destination I bought the ticket for. They however claimed I could use this for other destinations, which is not what I bought. I sued them and finally received my moneyback after 2 years, obviously with a steep commission paid to the lawyers. Aeromexico has no regulation or care for their customer. I am never going to fly with them again. Don't be swayed by their cheap prices, it’s all a cover up for poor customer service. ",Aeromexico

It’s unbelievable! Our flight from Mexico City to Vancouver on July 3, 2022 , flight number Am694, we are a couple. The flight was supposed to take off at 1:30 am July 3 but they delayed until 6 am. It means we already waited here for 4,5 hours - the whole night for the flight. At the boarding time, they just pulled us back and said that they need to check our passports, so we had to wait at the boarding station for 10 mins for their checking. We didn't know what they were doing, then we were released for heading to the plane. When we were about to get into the plane, right in front of the plane door, one of the staff just stopped us and said that he need to check if there were available seats for us. We did our check-in 14 hours ago and we got a ticket here, we got the seat number here and you did the checking, what do u mean u need to check if there were available seats for us. We waited there for another 10 mins and they just shut the plane door, right in front of us, left us there and the plane took off. We were so shocked by what was happening and couldn't believe what they did. The manager came and said that there was an error in our reservation so they could not let us board the plane. They will transfer us to the next flight without any other explanation. And we had to wait here another 3 hours for the next flight. They gave us business class tickers for the next flight but we didn't need them, we had been in the airport for 11 hours already and we will have to be back to work right after the flight. When we backed to the boarding station, they already issued new tickets and already took our check-in luggage out of the plane. We guessed that they took our seats and gave them to ppl who missed their last flight or whatever. We didn't know the real reason. Aeromexico, they just shut the plane door in front of us, left us there, and took off. Wow! We were so shocked and mad at what was happening. The reason they gave us is a reservation error, the machine couldn't read our ticket Q-code. That was not our false and they checked our passport twice, which means if there was something wrong they should have known abt it. They just did it to us for an unacceptable reason and didn’t care about if we accept it or not. Such a terrible experience! This is my first time with AeroMexico and also will be the last time.

So, I called again! This time we were told that the refund was issued and would hit our bank within 3-4 weeks. Now, we are at 36 days and counting. This is incredibly unprofessional and frustrating.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Dubai,January 2024,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2," This was my first trip on Emirates. I paid $1,400 for my economy ticket. I also paid to select my seats. I specifically chose an aisle seat because I have neuropathy and needed to ensure I could stand up regularly to avoid blood clots & not disturb others. Immediately, I noticed the man sitting next to me, sharing an armrest with me, that he dominated, was sniffing and digging hard up his nose every couple of minutes nonstop. He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was entirely grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. It was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes. I told attendants to observe his conduct too. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man, imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. Their eventual solution was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me and one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the section I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they attempted to move me to the very back of the plane. They said they couldn't say anything to the man. I didn't want to leave my companions. It was so frequent that I took evidence the entire flight to prove it. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the one from his tray to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. It was their jobs to help keep me safe. I was content in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But if those were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and still near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to avoid bodily fluids; put at a health & safety risk sitting next to a man openly wiping his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats, not the back of the plane.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Manila via Dubai,December 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,3,no,3," Check in desk at Montreal airport going to Philippines: We were traveling as a family with my senior mom, my wife and my infant that was 11months old. We did our check in online and made sure we chose a bulkhead seat to be able to use the basinet. To our surprise when we got to the plane they have changed our seats without letting us know. Very inconvenient and stressful since we where counting on those seats. The explanation they gave to us was that when there is a change of the type of plane they can not guarantee the seats we chose. I believe thats not a good reason to give and is a sorry excuse. If there is a change of any sort they have the responsibility to let us know I would have been glad to pay for a better seat. Morever, our return flight was even worst. At the checkein gate right before boarding,from Dubai to Montreal, they told us that we needed to check-in our carryon bags since there was no space on the overhead storage due to full capacity. We told them that we can not do so since we have an infant with us and that the carry on and baby diaper bags where a must, plus her toys,formula and food etc. They still refuse and told us we needed to check in our carry on. We were within what we were allowed to bring to the plane and still we needed to check in our things. I find this ridiculous. They do not meet the product that they are offering or selling and they have no sence of transparency at this point and a sense of understanding the situation we were in. The staff also was rude and just ignored my concerns. Not a family friendly airline thats for sure. Food and entertainment: horrible and tastless and the 2 planes going back from philippines to Dubai and transit then to Montreal my entertainement screen were broken. Staff in the plane I can clearly see that they do their best but are sometime not found when you need them, especially in a long haul flight when everyone is sleeping.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Athens via Dubai ,October 2023,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1,no,1,"   My wife and I along with 2 friends took the Emirates flight from Newark, NJ to Athens in September 2023. We had never flown on Emirates but decided to give them a try over American or Delta. The numerous tv commercials with actress Penelope Cruz has subliminally triggered something that inspired me to convince my wife and friends that we should give them a try. At the time of our ""economy"" booking we decided to pay an additional $410 per couple for seat upgrades. We had opted to pay more for the 2 seats together rather than the sitting in a row of three or fours seat in the center of the plane. As soon as we boarded the plane and took our seats I knew the outbound flight was going to be torture. The 2 seats that we paid $205 extra for were so small with walled sides and hand rests that didn't move would have been great if we were all contortionists but unfortunately we were not. We made it to Athens 10 hours later and after a couple of good nights sleep we put this horrible memory behind us so as not to ruin our 2 week long awaited vacation. About a week into the trip we did some research on the web and decided to downgrade our return seats from the same mini seats that we flew out on and instead opted for the standard seats that were in the middle section of the plane that included 4 seats. This was a great move as our return flight was much more comfortable. When I contacted Emirates upon our arrival and asked to get back the $205 paid for the return downgraded seats, their reply was that they do not issue refunds for seat downgrades. That said, the 4 of us will never travel on Emirates again. As a postscript I want to mention that none of the 4 our us, all retired and in our late 60's are heavy or have large behinds, to the contrary, we are all smaller individuals who have never had any comparable torturous seats while flying anywhere in the world. Unless you are Penolope Cruz and get complimentary ""first class"" seating or opt to pay the additional thousands of dollars, stay away from Emirates. ",Emirates

However, I was denied entry to the Emirates lounge, without any real explanation as to why. The gentleman at the counter was more interested in making me go away than helping me understand the situation, so, confused, I called Emirates ""customer service."" They bluntly informed me that if I wanted to use the lounge so badly, my travel agent should have booked the flight from Melbourne to Queenstown on Qantas. As it turns out, the leg from Melbourne to Queenstown that I had was on Emirates partner Jetstar. As Jetstar does not have a business class cabin, this one leg (out of 5 total legs) was economy. I should note that the entire itinerary was booked through Emirates, and part of my confusion stemmed from the fact that they all had Emirates flight numbers. But what I had here was an Emirates flight operated by Jetstar (and the same flight also had a Qantas flight number - one flight, three partners, three numbers). I should have gotten the Emirates flight operated by Qantas that was departing an hour later, as Qantas has a business class cabin, and it would have been the same cost anyway. If it's the same cost anyway, why not let me come in and take a shower? It's 1am and there is no one else here.

Every single request was taken seriously and was addressed to the best of the availability. I felt that I was the only special passenger for them, they were super nice and highly empathetic in their body language. The air hostess assigned to my area was asking me every single time she passed by me with a great smile if all was good. When you enter the lounge you are greeted with super smiles, if you ask them something they come close to you holding shoulders to show attachment. They were all super devoted to their work, full of energy and trying to help everyone as much they can.

✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Barcelona via Dubai,October 2023,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,3,"   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating and alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour?",Emirates
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Catania via Dubai ,August 2023,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"   I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior. Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation. My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation. To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza. This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses. The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. I requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing.",Emirates

I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing. Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company.",Emirates

The two flights to and from Botswana were operated by other airlines. On my way to Botswana I made a transit in Dubai and a transit in Johannesburg. On my way back things went bad. We arrived at the airport in Botswana (Maun) and the flight we booked on the Emirates website, was not present. We asked and found out that it had been replaced by another flight, operated by a different airline, at a different time. We checked in for this new flight and found out that no transit was possible in Johannesburg. Therefore we had to go through immigration, retrieve our luggage, queue again for the check in, pass security and passport control to get on our next flight to Dubai. To me it's unbelievable that Emirates did not care to inform us about the flight change and the fact that we could not make a normal transit, like on the first part of our journey. It's a pity because the flight experience has been good, with very nice crew and operating on time.",Emirates

Added to that however, was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Check-in, having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 check-in counters open for Online check-in. 2 were available for those who had not checked in, and these seemed to move more quickly. Once through, and with enough time to grab a bite at the airport, the greeting on board was initially friendly, but then the surly attitude of any staff with whom I came into any brief contact, (one, who removed my light hand luggage with laptop, to accommodate a passenger at the Emergency Exit, who's steamer trunk ""hand luggage"" could not fit into the overhead luggage bin above his seat, (which Emirates call ""hat rack""; if only). I had heard Emirates were the best on offer in this post pandemic era, but if that is the case, the standard must be extremely low. So low, a low-cost airline would make more sense.

Me and families never got a drink or any beverage at all. I phoned the crews so many times but they never attended us. When I complained to the crew she apologised and promised to bring us some drinks but she never appeared. On our way from Mauritius to dubai in flight EK 704 we got seats which were close to the toilet the floor was wet because of leak. Inform the crew and they took ages to bring a blanket to cover the floor. During the flights the cabin crews supposed to served drinks water or juice but they didn't. They look disinterested to provide a good service. They pulled the curtain so that you can't see them and they themselves eating and drinking. A lots have changed.

Well - in my view, lots has changed with Emirates in the last few years and I believe Quality has become Quantity unless possibly if you are flying Premium or Business. Despite being very polite, ground staff appeared disinterested in assisting for an upgrade both in Durban & Dubai and even their call centre. It was at least 2 hours into the first flight before we had either a drink or food and in 47B by then there was no more food choice. Compared to the other carrier I took south-bound to South Africa, screen on our Emirates B777 to Dubai was old and headphones on both flights uncomfortable. Transfer in Dubai required you are accustomed to your 10,000 steps a day. Sad but per two flights taken, it didn't appear reflective of all the publicity one sees.

✅ Trip Verified ,A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Milan,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected.

This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it.

Flight it’s self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions. The beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane. Overall I have had better experiences on other carriers.

What others have mentioned on these reviews is true, they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear. I have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused, some had broken features and a funny smell. The food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Dubai via Toronto,June 2023,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim. Lesson learned and no more Emirates for us ever!",Emirates

Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze).

Emirates is lauded as having one of the best inflight experiences in the world. They obviously spend a lot of money marketing the experience as such. The problem with this is that expectations are high. The hard product is good, all be it a little tatty. Service and food quality is poor. Options are limited and there is no dining in demand. It’s the first time I’ve flown business and had my meal served on a tray. Never addressed or welcomed by name aside from when my boarding card was presented on entering the aircraft. Crew were polite when you got their attention, but most of the time they were avoiding eye contact when racing through the cabin.

We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??",Emirates

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brisbane to Aucklqnd,May 2023,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated I’d need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I don’t think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we can’t use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical, Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the “Wit” family",Emirates

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Dubai,April 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who don’t move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry there’s nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldn’t eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldn’t fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they weren’t ready) and didn’t eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair. Honestly if I could cancel my return flight and book with another airline I would. I will never ever fly with emirates again.",Emirates

While I recognize economy class may not offer the same amenities as higher classes, I found the level of service and food to be subpar. Additionally, at Dubai airport, I was required to use an e-boarding pass, only to be informed upon arrival that a paper boarding pass was necessary, causing inconvenience. Furthermore, the air hostesses I encountered displayed a lack of professionalism and at times, seemed uninformed.

There was numerous issues. Food was terrible. Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines. Emirates was the worst. Turkish airlines offers the best food and customer service. I will never fly with Emirates. Lead cabin crew had no English and wifi is not free as they advertise. ",Emirates

They took  Americans because they have to and canceled our boarding pass after reaching gate and gave back our checked luggage. There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more. But we paid because as it was urgent travelling for us. From that moment onwards we decided not to travel with Emirates. Will never forget the incident and crew was worst.",Emirates

The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future. Highly recommend for those like myself who dread the long journey from Australia to Europe.",Emirates

The cabin staff told me ""don't worry"". Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn't take the bus on the runway, I wouldn't make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Colombo,December 2023,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," I recently had an incredibly disheartening experience with Lufthansa, and I feel compelled to share my ordeal to warn fellow travelers about the serious issues I encountered. My journey with this airline was marked by delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling, and subpar service. Flight Delays and Missed Connecting Flight: My scheduled flight was plagued by repeated delays, causing a domino effect that ultimately led to missing my connecting flight. The lack of communication and transparency during these delays left passengers like myself feeling frustrated and stranded. The impact on my travel plans was significant, and the subsequent attempts to reorganize my itinerary were met with unhelpful and indifferent responses from the airline staff. Baggage Woes - Not Once, but Twice: To compound the already distressing situation, my checked suitcases were not loaded onto the flight not once, but twice. The first instance could be considered an unfortunate mistake, but the recurrence of this issue raises serious concerns about the airline's operational reliability. The inconvenience of arriving at my destination without essential belongings is simply unacceptable, and the lack of a proactive solution from the airline further exacerbated the problem. Subpar Service: Throughout the entire journey, the service provided by Lufthansa Airline was nothing short of disappointing. From unhelpful staff during delays to the apparent lack of a well-executed baggage handling system, it became evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for this airline. The attitude of the staff members was indifferent, bordering on disrespectful, further adding to the negative experience. In conclusion, my experience with Lufthansa Airline was a complete letdown. The accumulation of flight delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling (repeatedly), and poor service has left me with a resolute decision never to use this airline again. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for those considering travel with Lufthansa. There are undoubtedly more reliable and customer-focused options available, and I strongly advise against choosing this airline for your travel needs.",Lufthansa
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Dusseldorf,July 2023,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight from Catania to Dusseldorf on 30.July (flight number: LH1909) was cancelled by Lufthansa (I received the cancellation Email). Then, we contacted them through online chat and their employee booked us with Eurowings airlines (as an alternative flight) for the same day (30.July), and he/she sent us the confirmation Email, which I kept it as an evidence. On 30.July, we went to Catania airport to get on the plane and we realized that our names are not in this flight list! Moreover, apparently, that flight had been deviated to Palermo but nobody had notified us. Anyway, we called their call center and after 5 times of try (because every time the call was interrupted due to an unknown reason!), finally one of their employees confirmed that ‘we can immediately book you in the Lufthansa flight on 10:10 AM on 30.July (from Catania to Frankfort and then Dusseldorf). We rushed to the counter, but at the counter we realized that our names were not in this flight list too Then, after 10 times of calling their center, finally their staff booked us the flight on 31.July from Catania to Dusseldorf. They even checked us in (I have the confirmation emails), but we received an Email saying that this flight got cancelled too. I had an online chat with their staff (named Jordan), but he did not assist me and even refused to book a flight sooner than 3.Aug for us with another airlines, though I told him that we cannot wait here more than this because both of us have to restart working from Monday! This was an exhausting process, and nobody answered us in the right way. At the end, we had to buy a flight ticket by ourselves from Palermo to Dusseldorf and came back home with lots of difficulties. We have spent extra money for staying in Sicily for one more night, travelling from Catania to Palermo, and also buying a new flight ticket from another airlines for our return. Lufthansa refused to refund us any of these expenses, neither compensated their cancelled flight,",Lufthansa
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Warsaw,January 2024,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,3.0,2,no,6," Well, to say that this particular flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw and back was a disaster would be an enormous exaggeration as I was punctually brought to my target destination, nevertheless I'm not fully satisfied with it. To be honest, it's quite unfair from Lufthansa's side to provide a service similar to a low-cost carrier but to set prices and to advertise themselves as a premium airline. As for now Lufthansa has learned all the ""tricks"" from the arsenal of an average LCC to limit the options for a passenger and hence to have a possibility to make everything payable, e.g. no included checked luggage (well, that's the only thing I support as many passengers don't need to have and to pay for this option), no free seat selection, a very limited meal service on board (a small bottle of water and one chocolate bar). They even managed to bring a calibrator to the gate and to measure the size of hand luggage and that looked really miserable. What made me especially angry is this ""boarding by groups"" which means if you randomly get a seat that belongs to ""group 5"" you will need to wait up to 40 mins in the queue. The announcements about which group is currently boarding are barely hearable so you have to keep your attention and to wait near the gate for quite a long time. Another unpleasant thing that should be avoided was that both times in Frankfurt the aircraft was positioned in the remote corners of the airfield so we had an ""exciting"" long trip to the plane in a cramped bus. I admit that there could be technical reasons for doing that, but it looks like more ""uh, it's just Warsaw, not Zurich or London, the public flying to this destination is not so demanding so we can provide a mediocre service and nobody will complain"". When I take a LCC flight I can fully accept all these issues because the low price justifies them, but it's not an excuse for Lufthansa. I have never taken the long-haul LH flights and I can believe that the situation is better there, but on European destinations I consider Lufthansa to be not fully competent and I tend not to choose it in the future.",Lufthansa

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Dubai via Munich,January 2024,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Thanks to Lufthansa 2024 didn’t start particularly well. I’ve had a return trip from Dubai to Amsterdam via Munich with Lufthansa. That was my first time flying LH and I thought they used to have a good reputation. The trip began with the 3hrs delay from Dubai. After arriving to Munich there was no person to connect the bridge to the plane and let people disembark. Since I missed my connection I was rebooked on the last flight available that day. Again, the boarding was delayed because they couldn’t find a crew member. That part still leaves me speechless. Finally our flight departed with people sitting on their bags due to lack of storage compartments. That was more like a scene from a bus in the suburbs, rather than the safe environment up to aviation standards. On the way back from Amsterdam of course the flight was delayed as the inbound flight landed late. I also got to learn that the airline is saving costs on cutting the ground staff. There was 2 check in desks where *priority* passengers could get assistance. The remaining peasants checked in their luggage by themselves and pray for it to actually make it to the plane. After another couple of delays on both of my flights we got welcomed by the crew member who didn’t even bother to pretend like she was there to assist people. I did her job helping people around me to find space for their luggage, while she was standing there and yelling that we need to take it to the front. Her charming personality then continued glowing throughout the flight when she would keep knocking people’s heads with her elbows and pretending she didn’t notice. Kicking passengers personal belongings under the seats with her feet was also very welcoming. This wasn’t even the end of it. The cherry on the cake is that after finally arriving to Dubai I received an email stating that they lost my suitcase. Here’s where I also learn that there’s no customer support team or anyone to follow up with, as of course, that would mean paying people salaries. There’s no phone or email communication from Lufthansa. You do get a wonderful chat bot option which is basically talking to yourself. Now it’s been 2 days and they don’t even know in which country my suitcase is, and there’s no one to even do the job of trying to locate it. I’ve traveled a lot with different airlines in different parts of the globe. Starting from the largest in the world and finishing with the ones flying propeller planes in the third world countries. I’ve never experienced as much disorganization and indifference in my life. After this situation I went online and checked the feedback about their services and now I’m not surprised at all. Lufthansa used to be a flagship of European aviation. I don’t know if management is not able to control large operations, or they simply cut so much on staff that there’s no one to do the job. If you want to play Russian roulette then go for it and fly Lufthansa. For myself, I’d rather ride a camel from Dubai to Europe than ever step on their airplane again. Considering their efficiency it would take at much time to get to my destination with my belongings intact.",Lufthansa

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Windhoek via Frankfurt,August 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"   Christmas 2022 we booked flights from London Heathrow to Windhoek, via Frankfurt, thinking Lufthansa was a reliable airline. How wrong we were! Our whole experience, which is still ongoing, five months later, ruined our holiday of a lifetime. It started before we had even left home for the airport, when I tried to book inflight diabetic meals for my husband. This has never been an issue with other airlines but, although Lufthansa offers eleven choices of meals, these do not include a diabetic option. Even at the airport, their staff couldn’t find the option for us. The stewardess kindly put a note on my husband’s records, asking for the said meal on the return flight but this didn’t happen.  On landing at Windhoek, we found that one of our suitcases had not arrived.  We queued with others to report the missing case and completed the form derived by their QR code. I received an email confirming the loss and promising an update within 24 hours. I am still waiting for it. We now had to go into a city we didn’t know; find a shopping centre, we didn’t know, and then find shops to replace essential items, including my husband’s medication.  During our stay in Namibia, Lufthansa repeatedly changed our return flight times, the details of which were emailed to me and I had to confirm within a certain time frame. No allowance was made for the fact we were in a country with very poor Internet coverage. At times I couldn’t even get reception on my mobile phone. So, when we arrived back in Windhoek, to catch our flight home, I found their email cancelling our seats, as I had missed one of their emails.  On using Lufthansa’s webchat, to rebook our return flights, we were told our flights had been cancelled because of industrial action at London Heathrow. When trying to claim compensation, after our return home, we were told the flight was cancelled: because of bad weather in Windhoek and the plane couldn’t land and when I emailed them that we were already in Windhoek and the weather was fine, we were then told the weather was bad at the airport the plane was flying out of to get to Windhoek. Eventually we received compensation for the so called cancelled flights. Although we could claim for accommodation and meals, no allowance was made for three days lost pay; extra vehicle hire; extra fuel nor extra entry fees – all of which were occurred or forced on us.",Lufthansa

Firstly, the space between the seats is almost zero,let alone if the person sitting in front of you leans the seat backwards. I was unlucky enough to spend more than 1000€ for an economy seat, having to share my space with the person sitting next to me, because they weighted a few more kilos than a supermodel! After that, the headset wouldn't work, so I had to replace it with another one that also wouldn't work, so to realize that the base of the headset was broken, so I didn't have the chance of enjoying a movie or sth. The crew was kind enough to help me out, offering a headset from business class, but it also didn't work. As a gift, they offered me a voucher for wifi connection, however, the usb charger would not charge my phone enough.

I contacted other airlines in the Star Alliance, Turkish Air, Air Canada, Emirates, not one had issues flying with a wrist cast, Lufthansa was the only one.

For two months, there was no response when I tried to get an email from them citing the cancellation reason because it was needed by my travel insurance company. Calling them was no use either, because the person on the line did not understand my request and said they only handled reservations. During the flight, the seat mechanism broke - so the air stewardess had to adjust it manually by hand. Their service was attentive and excellent.

No assistance to find luggage space in the overhead lockers by my attendant. Told to find it myself. When I suggested the carry on excesses were an airline issue he dismissed the complaint. Not his problem. Collectively it is.​ Seating tight spacing for a large build nation's peoples. Boarding sequence good window seat, then middle seat then aisle. Some staff friendly and try to make it pleasant. I watched staff transacting a drink with the cart blocking the aisle while holding up a passenger who clearly urgently wanted to access the toilet, the staff only had to move half a meter forward but spent time ensuring the passenger knew they were ""BUSY"" and would finish the transaction before moving.

I could not watch the screen because of the closeness and I could not pull my table down to the proper level. The Flight Attendant had to force the women to put her seat upright so I could eat. It was back down as soon as we were done. Getting up and getting out of the seat to the bathroom was ridiculous. And there were no individual air conditioning vents to adjust the temperature.

What I love about the food in the lounge is that they serve an indian dish such as Aloo Dum frequently and I really adore the taste! Also, the showers are cleaned well, very good facility to freshen up and they provide L'Occitane products in the lounge. Boarding from an Apron position and passengers had to wait inside the bus for about 10 mins, before pax could enter the aircraft.

Guess what the new baggage processing machine got stuck this time and was not able to process the luggage. Had to wait 20 mins for someone to come and manually solve the problem.  Nevertheless, we thought that should be it we can fly and not worry about the luggage but it was too soon for us to calm down. We land at the destination and our luggage is not there. So, if you have problem with this new ""automatic"" baggage submission process which in turn results in manual problem solution and baggage delay till at least the next flight. Unnecessary and too much automatization of something that already worked well and no real solution when the new system fails and that is on top of a Ryanair like flight experience in a travel of nearly 5 hours with sandwich and no entertainment on board.

To my emails I only get generic answers asking me to go to their website and fill out the same forms I already filled out and even with two visits at different airports I was unable to speak with someone who can give me any information whatsoever. At the counter they don't know anything and the office in Munich was closed on a weekday during business hours. Same thing in Mexico. Every budget airline I have used had better costumer service than Lufthansa and this is only a review of in total 5 flights this summer, of which only one had no major problems. Now I have to file for the compensation for the lost suitcase and with the experience I had until now with Lufthansa I'm sure this process will be a nightmare too.

They are a little cheaper than United on the same route and most of the time they are on time. The food and service is mechanical but efficient. I was excited to get a first look at Boeing 747-8 and thought seating on the double Decker would be fun! Alas! Who knew seating 'higher up' does not mean elevated experience. The business class seats at the upper deck are similar to down below, except it's 2-2 instead of 2-2-2 due to narrower space. The design of this business class (including lower deck) works for a couple but for people flying in business, does not make much sense. There are ample of holes if you are seating on the window seats but none for the passenger seating in the aisle seats. The seat was ok, it reclined fully and did it's job. I may have gotten a few hours sleep. The worst part was the screen and video. The touch screen barely worked. The remote was slow but did work, however, the screen resolution is worst than older box TV. The noise canceling headphone did cancel noise but every time there was turbulence, it made weird sound. Overall a good experience but could be improved. I like Polaris seating arrangement better. However, the wine and beer selection in Lufthansa is a tad better. ",Lufthansa

And again typing e-mail addresses and more information. Then we had trouble with the baggage drop off. Finally we used the check in counter with Lufthansa staff and it worked. The flight itself was good with a nice crew and on-time arrival. The return flight was smooth: check-in in Helsinki was fast and easy, staff was helpful. Onboard experience was fine: again a nice crew and punctual arrival in Frankfurt. Economy seats in Lufthansa’s A320 are comfortable, but there were no power outlets and no IFE screens.

But the remote control is not good, the screen luminosity is poor and the the browsing of films is made only for people with good eyes. Screen font are so small.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Munich,September 2023,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2,no,1,"  My experience with economy class seating comfort on the recent flight has been completely appalling. I have submitted my feedback to Lufthansa, and for this I have received a copy-pasted template response that have denied my request to compensation when I have not made or implied this request any at any point. Lufthansa made it clear that the comfort experience was as-intended by the company. The crux of the issue was lack of upper body ergonomics in the seats - while there was decent legroom provided, there was no way to rest my upper body without disturbing the passengers next to me, no matter how I tried to contort and what sitting poses I would pick. At its root, there is just not enough space between you and the forward seat ahead when it is reclined (which it will be on a long transatlantic flight!), the arm rests were useless, the angles between your body and seats/walls were uncomfortable, and the seating surface was just a bit too short.  Additionally, the in-flight entertainment gets a low rating due to brightness issue compounded by lack of space - if the IFE screen is off, any time you try to move in your seat you will bump against it... at which point the screen comes back on at default brightness. This means it'll shine bright in your face and disturb people around you many-many times over on a dark flight. The default brightness is extremely bright for a dark flight condition when everyone is trying to sleep, and there seemed to be no way to make the IFE remember the brightness level. I did not use IFE for its intended entertainment purpose, so I cannot rate the media contents. The second short flight using A321neo was just OK. It provided the basic level of comfort, but was nothing to write home about. The other aspects of my flight were not notable in the context of just how very uncomfortable the seating was.",Lufthansa
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Katowice to Frankfurt,September 2023,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I had an unpleasant experience while on board a Lufthansa flight from KTW to San Francisco via Frankfurt. On my flight to Frankfurt, first I witnessed a flight attendant loudly screaming at another employee before boarding.  Once on the plane, the same flight attendant yelled at passengers to not bring their bags on board, instead insisting they leave their carry-ons at the foot of the airstairs. I understand the issue, but I didn’t know how it all works, and I was connecting in Frankfurt, I politely asked the FA, if I could please keep my only one bag pack with me since my connection was tight. She raised her voice and yelled that everyone here has a connection and walked off. Very rude and unprofessional. My arrival gate was in the B concourse and my connection was in Z. It would have been very difficult to wait for my bag with such a long distance to travel within Frankfurt Airport. Fortunately, another passenger told me we could get our bags while leaving the plane, before boarding the terminal bus. It's a shame it took a fellow passenger to explain things to me and deal with my concerns. The FA on the other hand, was rude, unprofessional, and from my point of view, on a power trip. I told her this as I was disembarking the aircraft and felt worried, she would have removed me from the flight had I asked more questions. Customer service is something that she is definitely lacking. Instead of dealing with a legitimate passenger concern, she pulled a power trip on me without any explanation directing people is not acceptable. Only one sentence was needed from her, that “we can pick up our baggage right after leaving the plane, before we will get on the bus”, instead yelling and screaming on passengers.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Beirut via Frankfurt,September 2023,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1,no,3," Last time I travelled was in 2020, I understand prices went up but!! I paid 2000$ and it was the worst flight I’ve ever been on, even the service was less than mediocre. I’ll start with the delays: all of my 4 flights were delayed by 1h30min to 2h because of some lame excuse: plane not here yet, another plane blocking us, cleaning the aircraft. I was exhausted before starting my 7h flight and they overbooked, so they started asking passengers to give up their seats and take another flight with a different airline (of course paid and everything but still). Now Cabin Staff service: I am short, therefore I cannot reach the cubbies on top to put my luggage and that’s why I didn’t have a carry on since I was traveling alone. They made me put my small purse in the cubbie which is fine for safety reasons. When I was allowed to take it back, I got up to reach it, but I couldn’t. Everyone looked at me while I was jumping trying to open it and when I asked for help, the hostess rudely said: “I’m not tall either” and told me to wait. I sat down and waited for an hour, no one showed up to help. My anxiety was getting worse, I needed to disinfect my table and screen before they served food and beverages. I awkwardly asked the guy next to me to help me get my purse and I’m thankful for him. Now entertainment: There was nothing interesting to watch. Thank God they had wifi so I paid for it and watched on my phone the entire flight. Food: It was ok. I’m not that picky. Long story short, I don’t recommend Lufthansa for long flights, maybe a flight up to 3h maximum. They are not well organized, it vey poorly managed, everything was chaotic and uncomfortable. Not worth the money I paid, and I was frustrated from the delays alone before stepping into the aircraft. ",Lufthansa

I was originally booked to fly from London City Airport to Frankfurt on the mid-morning flight but the inbound aircraft could not land due to dense fog at that time and the aircraft was eventually diverted to Gatwick after several go-arounds, so my flight as cancelled at the very last minute (when all passengers were waiting at the gate to board). There appeared to be only 2 Lufthansa ground staff at London City airport managing this flight and the senior member was unfriendly (she was borderline rude to some passengers who were understandably worried about delays leading to missed connections in Frankfurt) but her colleague was much more sympathetic. I bypassed them both in the end by reaching out to Lufthansa using their web chat on my phone internet whilst still at the airport gate, and was rebooked on to a later flight from London Heathrow airport, though the web agent had to wait for the Lufthansa computer system to “officially” recognise that my original flight had indeed been cancelled (which took a few minutes). I was then rebooked and checked-in automatically and my new boarding pass emailed to me immediately. I appreciated that I had automatically been allocated an aisle seat on my new flight, as I had paid for an aisle seat for my original flight. So basically the web chat agent had been very helpful. After that I was reliant on the Lufthansa ground staff to walk us (all affected passengers) back to “land-side” from “airside” of the airport. Luckily I did not have check-in luggage to wait to collect, so I immediately travelled across London (at my own expense) using public transport from City airport to Heathrow airport for the early afternoon flight to Frankfurt. This was a totally full flight due to accommodating others who had missed the City flight like me. Boarding for this flight was by zones, and I saw some people’s cabin luggage (those with carry-on cases) being weighed at the gate itself to check for compliance with the 8kg limit. This flight took off half an hour late (not unusual for any Heathrow flight, of any airline). We received one small bottle of water and chocolates for free. Anything else to eat/drink had to be purchased (card only accepted; not cash). Service was pleasant enough. In the end I was just happy to have made it to Frankfurt, albeit 5 hours later than planned.",Lufthansa

If you enjoy stress, frustration, and zero accountability, then, by all means, book your tickets with them. If not, run in the opposite direction! Let's start with the baggage debacle. Yes, Lufthansa lost not one, not two, but FOUR of my bags! They're trying to prove they're the masters of mishandling luggage. And the cherry on top? Their communication was a joke. I felt like I was playing a guessing game with my own belongings. But the real kicker? When I reached out for compensation, they dared to respond with, ""According to our record, the baggage irregularity happened at your home airport. Please understand that we cannot comply with your compensation request under these circumstances."" Seriously? So not only did they lose my bags, but they also refused to take responsibility for their mistake! Now, let's talk about customer service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to deal with unhelpful, indifferent, and unresponsive staff, Lufthansa has you covered. They've taken a crash course in making customers feel like a burden. Oh, and the fun doesn't stop there. Last year, I had the ""pleasure"" of going through the same ordeal with Lufthansa's baggage mishandling. You'd think they'd have learned from their mistakes, but nope, they're consistent in their incompetence. So, if you're into mind-numbing frustration, long waits for your lost bags, and dealing with staff who seem to need to learn what's going on, Lufthansa is the perfect choice for you. But if you value your sanity, time, and belongings, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this airline.",Lufthansa

The seat is outdated, since years already, as well as the entertainment system. On the other hand, food and quality of wines offered was quite reasonable. Tried this time the new system on the internet for advanced booking of the main course, which gives more choices than what on the onboard printed menu is. Basically a win-win, as the airline can save on meals and avoid throwing away “left-overs”. But don’t think one gets rewarded with something that extensive (and luxurious) as some Asian airlines offer: it is miles away from such thing. Also the booking process through their website is quite complicated (or hidden), so when I got my pre-ordered main course I was surprised it even worked.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo and A321neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Glasgow via Reykjavík,September 2023,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,4.0,4,yes,6," Went for vacation with PLAY airline from Toronto to Glasgow (via Reykjavik) on September 4, 2023 and back on September 15, 2023. That was the first and so far the only experience with Play. 1) Purchasing tickets online and the website: The whole process is quite easy and straightforward. There are several fares to choose from. However, even if you choose the cheapest one, you can always add other services needed like reserving a seat, purchasing check-in/carry-on luggage, booking transfers, etc. The website looks nice, didn't have any issues. However, I've seen people complaining about it, citing system breakdowns, slow responses, etc. I had an unpleasant event after purchasing the tickets: one leg of my flight (KEF to GLA) had gotten cancelled and I was presented with 3 options: get a refund, reschedule the flight or convert it to a voucher for future trips. Luckily, I rebooked myself on a flight one or 2 days earlier that initial date and there were no cancellations afterwards. 2) Boarding and airplanes: The airline lets you check-in and get your boarding pass 24 hr before the departure time. I checked-in maybe 1-2 hours after check-in got available and to my surprise I got window seats for both legs of the flight. Moreover, the seats were just the same for my return flight. I was flying from Hamilton Airport (ON, Canada) and can say that the airport is tiny. Yes, there are poor shopping and food selection, but you quickly pass all the security and controls. Also, lines up are really short (especially, compared to Toronto Pearson Airport). I was flying A320neo to Reykjavik and A321neo to Glasgow and vice-versa. The A320 seemed older and in worse condition than A321. The interior of the latter was really good and looked brand new. It had a ""holder"" for your phone embedded in or on the top of an eating tray. Also, only A321 had power outlets. The legroom at both airplanes is small. I needed to stand in the rear of the plane for while to survive almost 6 hr flight. 3) The flights and transfer: During the flight, you can't access Internet (no Wi-Fi onboard is available) and there's no in-flight entertainment, so make sure to charge your electronics and have movies and series downloaded on your devices and you should be fine. Fortunately, all of the flights were on time and I didn't miss any connections. The flight were good and smooth. The seatbelt indicator was usually off. The Reykjavik flight was almost fully occupied, but the occupancy for the Glasgow flight was low. I'd say, maybe 60%. Once I had landed in Reykjavik, I was a bit confused as you don't pass any border officers, but quickly get to airport lounge/boarding area. It would be nice to see airline's representative not only while they put a sticker (for the flights to Canada) on your passport during daytime, but also when you take an European leg/flight during night/morning time. The good thing about the Reykjavik airport is that it has a smoking area on the premises. Landings were smooth and easy. Pilots are doing a great job. 4) Summary: Flying with PLAY can actually be a bit cheaper than with other ""regular"" airline. However, it requires an extensive planning and calculations as only a random seat is included in the cheapest fare. You have to pay extra for anything else, including seats, baggage, flight changes, special requests, etc. Also, the food on board is very limited and extremely expensive. So, make sure to bring yours or have a meal before.",PLAY
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Iceland via New York,October 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," My flight back home (Amsterdam to Iceland to New York) was canceled by the airline on 10/19/23. They offered to put me on a later flight, but their website is impossible to navigate. I finally picked the flight option for 10/22/23 (3 days later tha my original flight!) At that point, my wife and I already had the blood pressure thru the roof! 12 hours later, the airline emailed that there were no seats available on the selection they had already approved so I was asked to pick a later day. I tried for several hours to speak to a live person, but Play Airlines does not even have a desk at Amsterdam Airport! They do not have a telephone to call. They only communicate via email or social media and, even the, we only got automated replies. After all of that frustration, I decided to book a flight with another airline, which cost me $800 one-way ticket for each person ($1600.) I also had to pay $450 for 2 nights at a hotel near the airport. Plus meals, transportation, etc. By choosing another airline, I would not get any compensation for hotels, meals, or other expenses. I would only get refunded for the flight that was canceled. I was forced to make the above decision because PLAY could not be reached in any manner and I was afraid I would be stranded in Amsterdam for at least one week. So, I was forced to spend about $2500 (non-reimbursable) because PLAY canceled a flight and it does not have live customer service.",PLAY

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Paris via Keflavik,July 2023,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,2,no,5,"   Interacting with PLAY wasn't a pleasant experience, which began in June 2023 for a July 2023 flight to Paris, when I needed to speak with a customer service rep concerning a ticket issue and could only communicate with someone via Facebook messenger. And then my departure at BWI wasn't the best experience either. The PLAY staff members who checked the luggage and who took the boarding passes was very unprofessional, yelling on the intercom to tell passengers that they better give her the correct boarding pass to KEF Reykjavik, the connecting flight. The flight was delayed for no apparent reason; it wasn't raining on July 12th. The seats were cramped, and there was no air conditioning on the plane. Because it is a no-frills flight, water, food, and snacks were for purchase. There was no Wi-Fi, not even for purchase. Family members who I traveled with were shocked to have to pay $100 for luggage on the return flight, when it was the same exact luggage they came with, fulfilling the weight requirements. And again, for the flight returning to BWI, via KEF Reykjavik, was notoriously late, which meant rushing to get on the connecting flight to BWI. There was no type of organization for passengers to board the flight ... just a bunch of people crowded around each other. And it was hot on the plane, again. I shared a review on PLAY's Facebook page and it was deleted. This is an airline that I won't be using ever again.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Porto to Keflavik,September 2023,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,4,no,1,"  Due to my anxiety and panic issues, I always choose to buy seats that ensure I'll be sitting next to the person I'm traveling with; it's a way for me to feel secure. However, upon boarding the plane, I discovered that the seat I had purchased did not exist –  it simply didn't exist. PLAY, without consulting me, arbitrarily changed my seat to some random location, separating me from the person I was traveling with. As expected, I had an anxiety attack and had to take an anxiety medication to calm down, which ended up ruining a day of my vacation as I had to recover. Anticipating a similar scenario, I checked the seat assignments for my return flight and once again, contrary to the layout presented, the seats I had purchased were not next to each other. In this case, I had to buy new seats again to achieve my initial goal. In response to my complaint, PLAY referred to their terms and conditions, where they reserve the right to ""assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boarding of the aircraft. This may be necessary for operational, safety, or security reasons."" They refused to refund the value of the outbound seats, claiming that they had been changed to seats of higher value (completely ignoring the fact that they separated me from the person in my reservation). They only refunded the value of the return seats but claimed an exception. If PLAY can't guarantee the seats they sell, then why do they sell them in the first place? Let's imagine it was a minor child and a parent; would they also be separated? To what extent is what PLAY claims legitimate when they disregard personal well-being?",PLAY
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Paris via Reykavik,September 2023,2.0,5.0,3.0,,,1.0,3,no,1,"  I purchased a ticket to fly roundtrip from Washington to Paris, through Reykavik in September 2023. My flight leaving Washington was delayed due to weather and I missed my connection to Paris. I was auto rebooked to fly the next day to Amsterdam, instead of Paris. So, I was left to my own devices for finding a hotel, and getting transportation to and from the airport to my hotel. Play airlines does not have a human providing customer service or guidance for these situations in Reykavik airport. Upon submitting my receipts for reimbursement, I was informed that I would only be reimbursed for the cost of public transportation to my hotel. I used a private group bus service which was around 60 euros. When researching a train from Amsterdam airport to Paris, the first two trains available were sold out, and I had to wait 3-4 hours for a train with seats, which cost 169 euros. Similarly I was informed I would not be reimbursed for the full cost of the train. In the end, I was informed that I would be reimbursed 256 Euros. Of that, by law 150 euros would be attributed to my $220 hotel. When I asked for a breakdown of how they arrived at the full figure, I did not receive a response. When I decided accepting 250 euros reimbursement, might be the prudent course of action, I still have yet to receive a response, or a refund on my credit card after a week of follow up emails. PLAy provides bare minimum style transportation to and from Europe. They have next to no public facing customer service at Reykavik airport. The non-responses to my reimbursement claim makes me think that there is a ponzi scheme lurking underneath the bright red planes they fly.",PLAY

I had a great flight and value on Play Airlines. The young energetic flight crew was great and the everyone from the captain or the flight crew spoke English. My wife and I 6 hour flight went fast both ways across the ocean because we downloaded movies from Netflix. Both Play aircraft were A320 and looked like new planes. I loves that the plane had USB chargers at the seat. Life saver on watching a movie or charging my iPhone. We had the right size bookbag and 1 proper size luggage to carry on and a 1 proper sized bad for stowaway luggage. Play weighed our luggage and glanced at the size of our carryon, personal and stowed luggage and never said a word about any of our things. I did see some people that were unprepared, cost them plenty of money and didn't follow the rules. $100 charge Bag oversized so avoidable, was expensive also. I can't wait to go back to Europe on Play again at so much cheaper of a price than the other airlines. My experience on Play was great because I followed the Play Airline rules.",PLAY

Might as well spend the extra money on a flight so you don't get smacked with bogus extra charges. $300 for a 6 hour flight plus extra 90 euro for having a packback, where you receive nothing except a sore neck.

Passengers for a full plane were waiting at the gate, the Play employees had no idea what was going on. The security people were  rude and intimidating. The plane we were waiting for hadn’t even arrived yet, and we were told to line up for boarding! Why? We stood and waited for almost 2 hours before boarding started!!!

Its web site is a disaster and contacting them with any kind of problem is something out of the 19th century. They have no telephone number - none. Speaking with a person is impossible. They only have virtual representatives that take complaints and respond via email several days later. Changing or correcting anything through their web site is a veil of tears. It's hard to gauge what management at the airline envisions for its future. The basic fares are cheap, but everything else - seats, baggage, food, drinks, flight changes - costs money. I think I spent $30 dollars or so on my one flight for a drink or two. But this is the strategy they are pursuing: cutting costs means no margin for error.

I went through the security check only to stand in a line to wait for a bus, the bus brought us to the plane and we had to wait on a hot bus, we got to a hot plane with no air conditioning only to wait again for the plane to be refueled. The flight attendant had to open the middle door in order to get air into the plane. Leaving Reykjavik we had to wait going to the runway for some reason unknow to us, the explanation was given but it make no sense what the pilot told us. Then off to Boston. We had trouble hooking up to the jetway, the plane lost total power with no air conditioning running and only emergency lighting. The people asking for boarding passes at Reykjavik were ridiculous, four of them standing beside each other all wanting to look at our boarding passes, and everyone of them had to look. Carry on baggage had to be measured every time I passed the counter. Just by looking at my bag and the tag from the previous flight should tell you it would fit. It's all too much! No entertainment on the flight, no WiFi, and water at 3 euros a bottle is ridiculous. I'm safe to say I'll never fly play again.",PLAY

They don't give couples seats together even when booked at the same time months in advance. It's a money grabbing scheme to get you to pay hundreds more when you check-in and discover you are not seated together. Very despicable treatment. Even when it was explained that I have a severe fear of flying and needed to be with my husband for safety reasons. The no frills, no wifi, etc was expected but not this.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Athens via Iceland,August 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,yes,10," I just wanted to thank Play for being one of the most family-friendly airlines I have seen. We travelled with twin toddlers (& 2yr old) to Europe (two flights, 12 hours total with about 2-hr connection). The crew was unbelievably helpful. Few examples: they allowed us hang out at the back space - service prep area. They arranged to use empty seats (the tickets were booked in same row, but seating of two infants with 3 adults is not allowed due to oxygen mask limitations in any airplane). The flight attendants even offered to hold/rock the babies for a while during the inevitable melt downs and they offered tips on how to deal with them. All other aspects were as expected: on time planes, easy check-in, no problem with bags (we had paid online). We also checked car seats and a stroller and the stroller can be checked at the gate. Everyone was super-polite and very nice. The airplanes were clean and everything was great. Obviously the lack of entertainment (e.g., screens) and not having free food and drinks are not issues when one travels with babies on lap, as there is no time for any of this and the babies need a lot of work when not sleeping. As a matter of fact, it is much better to bring own entertainment when traveling with kids. We ordered food, beverages, coffee etc and the prices were reasonable. I recommend Play definitely for families with infants or toddlers, and for everyone else. I understand the comments that one needs to be prepared (in terms of screen/electronics needs etc), but again the food and drink choices are great and inexpensive. Quite frankly, it is way cheaper to buy food on the plane than anything from the post-security stores at Boston Logan and take with you on plane. Finally, I recommend to add bags online before the flight (along with car seats, strollers etc). We did that and the check-in process was so easy and the agents were so friendly. We also had to ask a couple of questions before the flight and the Facebook-Messenger platform responses were so fast. Keflavik airport is beautiful and people are so friendly. Passport check etc was very fast, which is very important when traveling with little ones. There was a security guard who informed us that there are free strollers available, which we used and our toddlers had so much fun with. Fellow passengers were mostly understanding and would even try to engage the little ones from time to time. Definitely there were people who felt annoyed and gave us some stares, but overall these reactions (both positive and somewhat negative) are expected. Overall, the experience was really great despite the challenges associated with traveling with toddlers, we will fly Play again and I definitely recommend Play especially to families with kids.",PLAY

Unfortunately my husband and I had COVID and had to cancel the trip on 04/14/2023 via eDreams. The total cost of the airfare including bags and seats were: $2,789.16 for all 4 of us. I received a response from eDreams on June 8,2023 saying that PLAY has refunded me the amount of $1975.97 directly via my Credit Card on 04/15/2023. With that in mind, I went online and checked all my credit card statements. I did not see any refunds with the amount of $1975.97. I called my credit card company to confirm and spoke to a representative and the representative confirmed that they have not received any refunds from PLAY nor eDreams. At this point, I decided to send a customer complaint to PLAY stating that I have not received any refunds from their company. I received an automatic reply from PLAY on June 11, stating the following: Due to a high volume of requests, we may take up to 6 business days to respond to a regular service request and up to 6 weeks to respond to a claim request. If you have an urgent inquiry, you can contact us on Facebook Messenger, and we’ll assist you from there.  As I was asking for a claim request; 6 weeks from June 11th is July 16th. I did not receive any email communications from PLAY on June 16th till today August 09,2023. I also tried reaching out via PLAY's Facebook Messenger on 08/07/2023. The rep wanted to confirm my credit card number. Which I did. It has been a total of 1 month and 4 weeks of business days since June 11, 2023 and no response from PLAY.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Washington via Reykjavik,July 2023,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,2," My boyfriend and I recently flew from Europe to Washington DC with a stop in Reykjavik. We had never heard of PLAY before but decided to give them a try because they were cheap and new. When we arrived at Reykjavik for a 1.5 hours stopover, we were told that the flight to DC had been replaced and we had to get new boarding passes. We (and many other passengers) ran to the service desk only to find out that they had separated us. I told them that we had paid extra in advance to choose our seats so that we would be sure to sit together in the long haul flight but they said too bad. After boarding several people had the same seats and people were standing up trying to find anywhere to sit. Looking through the other reviews on this platform, I can see that this seems to be a recurring problem for PLAY. When we got to DC they had lost our luggage in Reykjavik. We waited 2 days without any word and then on the third day luckily the luggage was suddenly delivered to our hotel. We had to shop for replacement clothing and toiletries and when we made a claim after they told us you can only claim USD 100 per person. In their response they said that we could have rented clothes instead of buying. I don't know where you go and rent normal clothes and shoes so I replied to their customer service representative that perhaps they should give this advice in advance and also on where to go a rent clothes in a strange city. Moreover, they said that we should have brought necessary extra clothing in our hand luggage - bearing in mind that you also have to pay extra for carry on luggage! This response is so absurd and the only really positive side to it is that I now get to show this email to friends who can then have a good laugh. All in all, PLAY feels like a discount airline with no on air entertainment or even water and we will most likely not be flying with them again. I do not expect a helpful response from PLAY as I have read their comments to the other reviews on here which seem to be very standard and insincere. I am writing this review because this is a new airline that I had not heard about before and I want to warn other potential passengers.",PLAY

There were at least 2 other flights from Baltimore and Washington that also missed their connecting flights. Most of us missed our flight but less than ten minutes. I’m not complaining about that, I get it missing a connection sucks, what happened after though is the most painful experience of my life. We were told by the staff to go out and wait for a representative by baggage claim. That they would help us with new flights. There is no one. We realize this pretty quick and try to connect to PLAY. They have no phone number.  There is no way to get a response. We even tried DMing them on Instagram. Nothing. Not from email, not from Facebook messenger not from their AI service bot. And we wait for 4 hours before someone finally comes and tells us that no one actually work at this airport from PLAY. Of the 250 people waiting half got an email that their flight had been rebooked. We never got a email to this day saying our flight was rebooked. We had to pay 700$ for a new one. We had to go on to rebook a new flight, stay the night and pay travel expenses( it’s about 80$ for a taxi in Iceland). In total about 1,200 spent because of this. Now here I am a week later no refund and I just got an email response asking if anyone had reached out to me yet. ",PLAY

I was able to look up all of this and tell people in the seats around me. We sprinted to our gate but unfortunately it was already closed, even though the aircraft was still parked right outside. Half that flight was standing by the gate wondering why they couldn’t let us on. Zero communication happened between the delayed flight and the missed connection, even though several enquiries were made and both were Play aircrafts. Play made everybody exit the airport, shuttled us to hotels without telling us the location of our hotel or if a new flight was booked. Several unaccompanied minors were involved in this. Currently still waiting to hear on the details of our reimbursement if we’re even getting one. Unprofessional airline.",PLAY
Not Verified ,A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,August 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Play is a terrible airline to travel with. The travel conditions are miserable, there is NO TV, NO Wi-Fi, No way to charge phone or any electronic devices, food IS NOT provided, food is sold, they have few options being sold is COSTLY, all food items are charged in Euro, NO dollars. The play does not give travelers baggage, even though tickets note that travelers are allowed a package. They have HIGH charges in baggage. When travelling recently, we were charged to pay for carriers' baggage to take inside the cabin. Things that do not exist with other airlines companies. THERE ARE NO BAGS ALLOWED in the cabin, except for very small backpacks. We had a terrible experience with PLAY, this has been our first and last time traveling with PLAY, and WILL NEVER RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO TRAVEL WITH PLAY based on the conditions highlighted above. Play staff will say that they are a low-cost traveling airline agency, but when you add up the money spent with BAGGAGE, FOOD and also traveling in such miserable conditions, especially when traveling with kids, you will spend more money. This leads to experiencing HIGH STRESS. It is better to use another AIRLINE agency that is more organized and more reliable than PLAY WHEN LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE FACTORS. PLAY as a company on its whole is disorganized, there is LACK OF COMMUNICATION between staff from one airport to another airport. We had an issue in ICELAND when we were requested to double pay carriers' baggage that was taken in the cabin that we already paid for in the departure location. Staff at this Iceland airport WASN'T Knowledgeable, did not have a better understanding of their system, and COULD NOT COMPREHEND despite telling them that carriers' baggage was already paid at the departure location. We had this issue resolved after requesting to speak to the airport SUPERVISOR who was nice, professional and understandable.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Stewart to Berlin via Keflavik,June 2023,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,3,no,3,"  Play airlines is a low budget airline so I expected the flight to not be super comfortable. What I did not expect was how terrible their customer service is or how antiquated their system is. I booked a round trip flight to Berlin from New York and opted for the basic economy rate on the outbound flight but upgraded to the FLEX rate on the return trip. Amongst other things it included, there was a free one time date change. A flight price difference could apply but there would be $0 charge for changing dates. I knew there was a possibility of needing to change dates so I upgraded. When going to change my flight, it had been saying $0 for weeks. The day I went to officially change it, one day before the original flight departure and within the allowable timeframe, there was all of a sudden a $289 date change charge. It was impossible to speak with anyone on the phone as they only have online chat support. The online representative dismissed it saying oh it must just be a fare difference nothing I can do. How is your system that bad that things just show up wrong. I also looked at the price of the flight now versus what I initially paid and it was not a $289 difference, so I have no idea where that number came from. I had to pay the amount because I had no other option. So I essentially paid $289 more than I should have plus paying the additional for the FLEX rate that did not matter in the end. The return flight plane was actually nice and comfortable, especially if you upgrade to the front of the plane. I considered flying with them again but after multiple attempts to reach out and no one able to give me a real answer or refund the incorrect amount, I will not be flying them again.",PLAY

All of my flights arrived on time or ahead of schedule. On all flights I was either in a row by myself or had the middle seat empty while I shared the row with another solo traveler.

Normally, we fly high-end airlines with all the alcohol, food, entertainment, pillows, blankets, and ear buds. For a sudden visit in mid-July, this was going to be a costly trip. Therefore, although we were full of much trepidation, we booked round trip flights from Washington DC to Glasgow via Reykjavik on this new game changing airline. Then, we read the reviews and fear struck. After reading the reviews we were full of doubts. We were just hoping to get there.  Four flights total. All flights were on time arriving ahead of schedule. The staff from initial check in to flight attendants and the pilot were all very enthusiastic, professional, and responsive to passengers. We could not have ask for anything more and will definitely fly Play again. And I must comment on the legroom and the comfort level of the seats. The planes are new and well designed with much more comfort and space than others. Plus we saved some money and had a great experience. My only advice is be prepared. Food and beverages are available for purchase in flight. Although the prices aren’t horrid, you can save some money by bringing your own food and snacks on the plane. Also bring a water bottle and fill it up before take off. I saw many people with pre downloaded movies on their devices. I just enjoyed a book.",PLAY

We were the first people to speak with the Play airline check in. We were not able to board because a ""green check mark” on our ticket because their site timed out when we tried to online check in on multiple occasions. This is clearly an administrative issue. 1. They did not have a plane available with the correct amount of seats. 2. They were unable to rebook us. 3 . Their site timed out, not allowing us to check in 4. Their customer service “representatives” were incompetent and did not have a functional computer or clearly the cognitive ability to direct 30 passengers in the same scenario and scoffed at our concerns. We and 30 other passengers were told to go home. There was no apology, no rebooking, and no assistance at the airport from any of the PLAY representatives. This is unacceptable. A 400$ compensation package was offered. Additional costs for flights on another airline are close to double what we initially paid. ""Apologies"" simply does not cover it.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Keflavik,July 2023,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,1.0,4,no,1,"  I am writing this review to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the travel experience we encountered with Fly Play on flight OG102. I must acknowledge our own contribution to the problem as we were running just a little bit late for the flight and we fully understand and accept that responsibility. However, what followed left us perplexed and disheartened. Upon realizing that the flight was delayed by approximately 50 minutes, my husband and I, experienced travelers, considered this a fortunate turn of events. We proceeded to the check baggage counter, which was unmanned – understandable given our tardiness. We decided to get through TSA and inquire about gate checking our baggage at the gate. To our surprise, we encountered an extremely rude and unreasonable gate attendant. We politely requested if we could gate check our bag. Unfortunately, her response was an immediate refusal without providing any explanation. This was particularly disheartening as gate check had been a feasible option in the past, including with Play in September. Our attempts to seek clarification or speak to someone else were met with further hostility. The gate attendant claimed to be the sole authority and refused any further assistance, which left us feeling unheard and disrespected. The situation escalated when the gate attendant intentionally covered her name tag and displayed an offensive gesture towards us. We were unable to board the flight and learned from the chat bot that we were labeled as ""did not fly due to inappropriate behavior."" This statement is categorically false, and we were relieved when Play ultimately offered discounted tickets as compensation after hours of pleading via chat and trying to come to some resolution. Nonetheless, we firmly believe that the entire situation could and should have been handled more professionally and with greater courtesy by your employee, who represents your company's values and image. While we understand that being late reduced our chances of boarding the flight, we firmly believe that every passenger deserves to be treated with respect and kindness. We would have gladly accepted any reasonable explanation for not being able to gate check our bag. Instead, the encounter left us with a sense of shock and disappointment that overshadowed the entire travel experience. We sincerely hope that this matter will be taken seriously and addressed appropriately to prevent similar incidents in the future. As loyal customers, we believe in the value of constructive feedback, and we trust that Fly Play will endeavor to ensure a more positive and respectful experience for all passengers.",PLAY

The seats are very comfy, which is not a given in economy class for 6,1 figure like mine. The service was very good, with attendants at my beck and call. The planes were very new too.

The booking was easy, as was the check in. There were no delays and everything went smoothly. There is a massive issue however with the fact that they don't have a phone number. Never deal with a company that can't be contacted by phone. If anything goes wrong, you're on your own. While everything outside the craft was fine, inside the plane is a different story altogether. Firstly, getting seated was an absolute farce. The lack of organisation by the cabin crew seemed to rub off on the passengers. Several people switched seats, meaning some found another person sat in their seat. I've never seen this before on such a scale and I can therefore only attribute it to the fact that the cabin crew were not checking boarding passes or directing anyone. Getting seated took longer than I've ever seen on an aircraft and at no time were the crew trying to speed things along. The plane started taxiing with passengers still stood up. The main issue with the flight was the seats. I have never seen this many rows on this type of aircraft. There is no way on earth these things should be in the air for more than an hour. I am 5ft6 and I had so little leg room that I could not physically reach down to pull my bag up. If you are 6ft+ you realistically cannot fly this airline.  As if this could not be any worse, the seats recline. Yes. They recline. The room in front of me was reduced to level where I could not put my tray table down. It was 6 hours of absolute torture. Some passengers spent the entire flight stood in the aisle as they could not sit for that long. Everything on this flight is paid for separately. Fine. It's a budget airline. I get it. But water? Surely this is a basic human necessity. It was 3 Euros for the smallest bottle of water I've ever seen in my life. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Not only is it torture but it makes no financial sense. After adding in the extra legroom seat costs (you will need it), water and food, you are likely to be saving little to nothing. Take a real airline. You'll thank me. I'm sure Play will reply with their ""hi thanks we're a budget airline as such"" spiel, but it's not good enough. These planes should not exist. And if they do they should be flying one hour domestic, not transatlantic.",PLAY

The short story is that they left us and our two small children stranded in NY at night with no plans, support or communication when our tickets were round trip to Baltimore. We are still fighting to get reimbursed for the cost of renting a car and driving to our actual destination. It was a total nightmare. Our flight home from Dub-Kef was delayed by over 3 hrs. Causing the 1 flight a day from Kef-bwi to be missed. We were given very little communication but eventually told that all missed connections were rebooked for the next day and passengers would be taken to a hotel. We went to the hotel and eventually late that night received an email with new flight info. So far, we kept a good attitude and considered it an adventure. However when we tried to check in for the flight we couldn’t and just got error messages. So we went to the airport the next day and we’re told that the new flight was overbooked! They offered us €700 to get bumped but said it could take up to 4 days to get rebooked and there weren’t any hotels available in town anyhow! So we declined and they finally said they put us on an Iceland air flight home. But when we got the booking email it was NOT to Baltimore it was to New York! The email said they were working on flights from New York to Baltimore and would email us when it was finished. The exact time the flight finished boarding, we received emails stating that they were unable to find connecting flights and we should “kindly find our own accommodations.” Upon landing in New York (where PLAY doesn’t have any agents) we were given no further help and told to file a claim on their web site. We had to pay our own way home. Now we are trying to get reimbursed but the communication doesn’t even make sense when they bother to reply at all. It’s like starting over every time someone replies.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Boston via Reykjavik,July 2023,1.0,3.0,,,,2.0,2,no,3,"  My wife and I just had our first experience with Play Airlines. I’m pretty certain it will be our last. First the cost: This “budget airline” tagged us for nearly $2400 r/t from Boston to Dublin in late June. (We booked months in advance.) That was less confiscatory than the other airlines, but hardly a bargain. That $2400 got us a checked bag and carry on per person. It didn’t buy us even a package of peanuts during the 9-10 hours we spent in the air. At one point I asked the flight attendant if I could have a cup of tap water. She said she could sell me a small bottle for three euro. Play is a hub and spoke airline, so all flights go through Iceland. That turns 5.5-6.5 hour nonstop flight into a 10-12 hour affair, with layover. On the long transatlantic flight, there is no seatback entertainment, not even any WiFi for purchase—which is odd since Play tries to make money off of virtually every other aspect of the flight. If it could charge for a trip to the bathroom, I’m pretty sure it would. The worst part of the flight, however, was the seats. I’m six feet tall. I accept that I’ll never get any sleep in coach. This was the first time, however, that neither my wife nor I could sit comfortably for even an hour—at least on the trip from Boston to Iceland. (The trip from Iceland to Dublin was more comfortable.) The seat cushions were wafer thin. There was little lumbar support. It goes without saying that there was no legroom, but the pitch—the distance between my seat and the one in front—was the smallest I’ve ever experienced. My wife and I had to switch seats when the chap in front reclined even a bit. Play’s penny-pinching apparently extends to its airport staff as well. We showed up at Dublin airport at 835 am on July 1 to check in for our return flight home. The queue was already packed. To deal with it, Play had one poor beleaguered attendant at the counter. (After about 75 mins of this they did bring in a second attendant.) We spent about 90 minutes in line waiting just to check our bags. To be fair, our trip off season would cost about half what we paid for peak travel. Honestly, I wouldn’t fly Play again if it gave me a free ticket. This isn’t “no frills.” It’s factory farming disguised as airline travel, with passengers penned in like chickens, valuable only for the dollar signs on our heads. Pay the extra money and get treated like a human being. We will.",PLAY
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Reykjavík ,June 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,3,yes,5," My experience flying to Dublin with Play was a positive experience. I had flown with a similar airline in the past and knew that I had to be prepared to follow the guidelines for baggage precisely and bring any food/drink that I wanted onboard to avoid additional costs. My return flight was not a positive experience. It was very stressful and there was almost no communication from Play during this stressful time. Our flight had been delayed and the communication about that delay was confusing or silent. The plane was not there at the time we were expected to board and there was no communication between that boarding time and the actual time we would be able to board. My group had a connecting flight in Reykjavík for 3pm that we realized we would miss, but when we asked flight attendants, they were unable to answer any questions. We did miss our connections flight and the only information we were told was to exit the airport to attend a meeting where we would find out more information. This is the situation I am most unsatisfied with. Exiting the airport felt like a bad idea, but that was the direction that was given if you wanted to receive more information. When we got to the meeting, there was no representative from Play. Only a man from the hotel shuttle service that told us Play was going to provide a room for us to stay overnight. No other options were presented. Due to a flight I had to catch in Boston for my friends wedding, I knew I had to fly out that day. So, I had to purchase a flight with a different airline and just hope to be refunded. Since Play had told us to exit the airport, I missed the next flight to Boston because there wasn’t enough time to gather my boarding pass and go through TSA. Luckily, I was able to catch the last flight out of Reykjavík and everything eventually worked out. I received an email that said my flight would be fully refunded and provided with some compensation, which I appreciate. I would still recommend Play because the flight is one of the most affordable options. However, my advice to anyone choosing this airlines is to be prepared. Do your research and read the policies closely because you will not be able to communicate with Play directly. After rebooking the flight with a different airline I spent the next hour or two researching Play airlines policies and that helped me feel better about receiving a refund for my flight. Play did not ever provide the option to rebook a flight with a different airline, or that in some cases they will rebook a flight and transport you to the rear by airport. The website I used to research policies is here: https://airlinespolicy.com/cancellation-policy/play-airlines-cancellation-policy/ I do not recommend calling them, customer service hung up twice.",PLAY

I am 19 years old and planned a once in a lifetime trip with friends. My friend booked the tickets and unknowingly they were booked without cancellation insurance. I was the only person in my group that did not receive my passport in time for the trip. Did all the things I could do in order to secure it in time (paid to have it expedited, contacted my local congressman, drove to wait on line to another state without an appointment to a passport agency, and called daily). The company only communicates through social media apps and a 3 minute conversation turned into days of back and forth since you have to wait for a representative to get back to you. They will not refund my money of $700 even though I was unaware that we did not have non-refundable tickets. My only option was to change to another trip which included paying a change of ticket fee and any difference in the cost of the new ticket (which would have been at least $1,000.) I stated that I could not do that since I wasn’t sure if my passport would come in time for this newly booked trip. If I didn’t receive it, I would have to pay another change of flight fee, along with another ticket. This could have gone on until I received my passport, which I have not received yet.

We had a two hour stopover and I just sat in transit area and waited. Play is a low cost carrier so you pay for what you need. I usually travel with an under the seat bag so I bought no extras.

Not to mention that the terminal where PLAY is located the AC was turned off.

I decided to use a different airline to get to Iceland and Paris. Play has no customer service number to speak of to contact with problems and the contact via email or chat feels scripted or worse an AI.

In my case, I was told my flight would be delayed or canceled approximately 1hr 30 min before their customer service hours ended.

However, all passengers were told to get our baggage back only at KEF, and we would make our connecting flights once at KEF. 10 minutes before landing, we were informed that all connecting flights had departed. Upon landing at the airport, not a single representative was available to speak to passengers. Half got emails with hotel accommodations/buses. I did not receive a single communication from Play. Not one message. I did not have a hotel room or ride from the airport. I could not contact anyone as the customer service was 'overwhelmed.' Passengers from the flight were wandering around the airport with nowhere to go. Many passengers went to hotels which were already overbooked. I ran out of my medication and was in physical pain for over 24 hours as I was already on my last additional dosage. I could not contact a single person and could not afford to get a different flight or hotel or accommodations, as I am still negative on my credit card bill.

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Keflavik to Tenerife South,April 2023,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,4,yes,8," Play is a low-cost airline so the tickets are fairly cheap, BUT the only thing included in the price is one personal item, like backpack which have to fit under the seat in front of you. When you have added extra luggage, the price is not so low anymore. We were a couple traveling to Tenerife from Keflavik with three kids from 5 to 11 years old. I had heard from others that even though all the tickets were bought together, you couldn't be sure that you would be seated together. So I added extra cost by buying seats. The check in process in Keflavik is great! You can choose self-check-in, and then you can also check in your luggage and don't have to wait in line at the desks. The aircraft is pretty basic (and low-cost). There is no tv's or entertainment, WiFi or anything, there are also no USB-ports for charging. Which I knew before, so I fully charged 3 travel chargers and had downloaded some movies on Netflix for the kids. The seats are comfortable and I really liked the foot space compared to other low-cost airlines. The menu on board is pretty basic, I recommend the baguette. The staff was friendly and kind. Overall, the flight experience was good - but Play being a low-cost airline, might reconsider their high prices for any extra luggage. It has been constantly going higher, and if the price in the end is at the same level of other airlines (not low-cost), people will rather go there and get a little extra on board etc. for the same money in the end.",PLAY
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington Dulles to Paris via Keflavik,February 2023,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3.0,2,no,3,"  Terrible experience. I’ll never fly with PLAY again. Our return flight on 11 February 2023 from Paris to Baltimore was to have a brief layover in Keflavik, but weather caused a delay. The delay then became a cancellation, which then became a delay again. Our departure went from 1130 to 2230 on Saturday 11 February 2023 as a result. After navigating the options provided to us we decided to accept the delayed departure, but because of the earlier cancellation, we had already booked with PLAY to depart on Sunday 12 February 2023 at 1130. We cancelled our taxi, had begun looking for a hotel near the airport, made arrangements for the care of our minor child who was at home in America, contacted our employers of the change and requested extra time off from work. All of this was for naught when the flight was merely delayed 11 hours. This required us to check out of our hotel, arrange for our luggage to be secured by them, schedule another taxi and spend extra time and money in Paris until the 2230 departure. At no point was an updated itinerary sent with the new time, nor were we sent an electronic boarding pass. Upon checking into CDG airport in Paris we were given our boarding passes to Keflavik, but no information regarding our next flight from Keflavik to Baltimore. No boarding pass, no explanation or departure time, no information from any employee at the PLAY terminal or from the flight crew while in flight or on the ground. We weren’t advised of where to go or what to do next. After landing in Keflavik at approximately 0300, we determined through a search that there is only one flight daily from Keflavik to BWI and the departure time was 1515 hours; an unplanned layover of approximately 12 hours. With no hotel availability, my wife and I spent 12 hours trying to sleep on hard wooden benches with all of our luggage piled around us. After showering, dressing and departing our hotel on Saturday we would now be faced with wearing the same clothes and no chance to shower till we arrived home over 36 hours later. We could not check into our flight from Keflavik to BWI until 1215; so we stayed close to the terminal that airport employees told us would be opened by PLAY personnel eventually. Passengers filled a “roped” off section near the kiosks where the PLAY check-in would take place. An employee told everyone inside the “roped” off area that they would need to move to a different “roped” off section which chicaned to 4-5 PLAY check-in counters. Passengers asked why they couldn’t just stay in the line and go to the counters. Her response was, This is not the line. The line is here, so you’ll have to go to the other line (not quoting, but words to that affect). This caused people to start ducking under the “ropes”, dashing around cordoned off areas into the other area or those of us who were outside to make our way into the designated area. There was no thought or consideration given to those who had been standing patiently waiting for the customer service counters to be opened. The bond female, then left and there we only two booking agents to deal with the throng of passengers waiting to check in. With 4-5 available “counters” there were only two customer service agents working. We were fourth in line and it took us 45 minutes to check in for our flight.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Keflavik to Baltimore,March 2023,4.0,5.0,,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,yes,8,"  The flight was on time, the plane appeared new and clean. A lot of space even in economy. Service was courteous and attentive. Overall, a very pleasant surprise. They charge for every single item, but the total price was about 30% cheaper than the alternative. The only negative is that they are not hooked into the TSA-Pre system, fairly minor point in Baltimore. Somehow strange experience in that you have very little interaction with human employees in the process. In Keflavik, you check in your own case, scan it and put it on the conveyor belt yourself. No telephone number to call - Everything is by social media. They do not have in-flight entertainment or wi-fi.",PLAY
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Reykjavik to Boston,March 2023,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  Terrible customer service. We would not have missed our flight if online check-in was available the day before but the website kept giving me an error and no one was available at the airport when we got there to check us in so we missed the flight. Most airlines put you on the next available flight but not PLAY! They had nothing to offer but sorry. Had to buy another ticket after spending an extra night in a foreign country. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t have a customer service phone number to call if something goes wrong!,PLAY
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Keflavik to Boston,March 2023,3.0,5.0,,,,3.0,2,no,2,"  Overall PLAY assistance and customer service was very poor. In Boston the assistance at the Boarding Gate was unprofessional. PLAY needed to arrive earlier. They needed to announce what the expectations more clearly, before all the confusion began. Passengers who did not have a red tag on their personal item and carryon needed to bring them up to the desk. Then people were charged $90 for bags that they normally can bring on other airlines as a carryon. The PLAY personnel kept leaving the desk. Passenger became anxious and kept cutting in line to be the next person served. No orderly process. Getting a boarding pass on MyPlay was extremely difficult. Several people asked us if we had as much trouble as they did. The site would need to be accessed several times. It finally worked for the trip from Boston to Keflavik, but not visa versa. I was confused when it asked if I had a check in bag, etc. I paid for it already. Fortunately, I was able to go back on the site and confirm my bag status. The boarding pass final step didn't provide a pass. A popup was shown, but I didn't get to read it. One person should have been available at the PLAY desk in Keflavik. We were not even sure it was the service desk, until security helped us. People want to move on and get through security. Also, at Keflavik we took a bus to the airplane. The priority people didn't get bused separately, so they were just mixed in with the crowd entering the plane. Again, unorganized. In general, the other parts of the trip were good. We left on time and arrived early. The plane staffs was good and Icelandic staff. The checked bags arrived quickly.",PLAY

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Faro to Liverpool,January 2024,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,3.0,3,yes,6,"  I should like to review my flight from Faro to Liverpool with Ryanair. I booked the seat with Ryanair several months before my planned travel and found the website clear and easy to use. Ryanair sent quite frequent emails relating to the flight and attempted to sell me extras. The check-in procedure was followed by a bag-drop at Faro Airport. This was not efficient and the app they recommended for speedy bag-drop did not work. Setting that aside, I was able to check-in my bag within less than 30 minutes of having arrived at the airport. Boarding was supposedly via group but this did not materialise at all. The cabin crew had a reasonable presence and delivered a serious safety procedure. During the flight the crew worked hard and had several rounds of drinks for sale. I found the seat suitable for a flight just under 3 hours. The flight departed on-time and arrived on schedule too. Disembarkation was delayed in Liverpool while this was not the fault of Ryanair, there was no communication with the passengers as to why this was the case. Disembarkation was not orderly and was poorly managed. Overall, a decent offering from Ryanair.",Ryanair

I figure I'll do it in the morning since I have plenty of time. it's low season and I don't have any checked in luggage. I live in Copenhagen not far from the airport. Morning comes and I try to check in online. No luck, apparently they close online checkin 3 hours before the flight. I figure I'll just check in at the airport at those self serve terminals. I arrive at the airport 2 hours before my flight and head for a terminal. Prompt says: kindly go to service desk. Head for service desk. They charge me 42 euro to check me in. The flight itself was 57 euro. They almost charged me the price of the flight just to check me in manually! And they forced me to check in manually by closing online and self-serve checkin. This is Ryanair policy. Apparently. Wizzair and booking are not without blame either, as they decide who they want to do business with.",Ryanair
Not Verified ,Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,Stansted to Pisa,December 2023,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,yes,5,"  The flight itself is operated by Malta air and I've always found their cabin crew to be very pleasant and respectful. That however cannot be said for their handling agents either in Pisa or Stansted. The Stansted bunch I have found to be rude, argumentative and hostile. Like they hate their work. Boarding no matter where is a shambles. You're invariably stuck in a freezing cold or roasting hot stairwell even before your aircraft reaches the gate. It's not a pleasant experience. Nowhere to sit. As budget airlines don't use jetties at the gate there is every chance that you're gonna get soaked going to and from the terminal in winter. Cabins are not the worst that I've been on. I'm a wee guy so 2hrs 30mins isn't too bad. As far as cheap fares go, I've yet to get a Ryaniar flight that I found to be value for money. All I can say about the flights is that they are generally uneventful and again the Malta Air crew are welcoming. I found that once you add on all of their ridiculous charges they are really not better value than companies like British Airways. It is worth remembering that whether you like Ryanair or not it gives us a choice.",Ryanair
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Beauvais to Barcelona,January 2024,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Staff is rude and has no manners, let alone be professional. I had a backpack with which I flew from Vienna to Paris through Ryanair without any issues. But while flying from Paris to Barcelona, they asked me to pay for the backpack. They have kept a small rack to check size of your carryon baggage, which is way smaller than the one we have in flight and as a result, high chances you will always end up paying. Because of this there was a long queue and one couple even missed their flight and instead of being considerate, they smiled and asked them to purchase ticket for another flight.",Ryanair

If you have a problem, they never listen and they never help. I had problems twice. I tried to explain my situation. They did not listen and they did not take me to the flight. I missed the flight because of their mistake. They did not even look at the evidence that I tried to show them. My family holiday became a tragedy.",Ryanair

They asked for a credit card to check for late check-in fee, we asked them to pay by our debit card or by cash, but they did not accept it. So we missed our flight, and they made us pay a No show fee on the application so that they give us another flight in the evening. The flight we got was about 30 Euro and the no show fee we paid was 100 Euro. When I told them in Germany we can pay by debit card or cash, they said we are an Irish airline it has nothing to do with Germany! Then why do you have your business here? The other thing is when I mentioned my nationality was not listed on your website they did not accept that and they inserted my nationality manually!",Ryanair

Flight departed early and arrived before schedule. Crew extremely well presented and professional. Ryanair does not have the most comfortable seats, and leg room is not the best, however for a 1 hour 25 minute flight I do not have much complaints. If you follow their baggage rules and basic online check-in, you won't have any issues.

Got it, it is for Safety. But you must pay for the seat selection of the accompanying adult so that you can choose the seat next to the child. Only allowed a bag pack to be carried on for free, ay other cabin bag you must pay. You pay if you don’t check in online. It’s €55 to check in at the airport. That’s more than twice of my ticket price. No room for any negotiation. By the way, even if the flight is delayed and you have time to do online check in for free, too bad, just pay.

There is basically no way anymore that you can convincingly plan longer trips with them, for example a train journey after arrival, because you never know when you arrive. Today, we are loosing another train ticket that we bought ages ago in advance, when we still believed that some delays are exceptions to the rule, rather than the new rule. Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay. We should not reward such an airline for what they do to us. And then better check always the prices of competitors: Eurowings, EasyJet, Vuelin, Wizzair, anything that stays within a reasonable price for the package might be worth considering.",Ryanair

Outbound flight on time, clean aircraft and Cabin Crew friendly and well presented. Great value for money. It was cheaper to fly to Dublin for the day on Ryanair rather than go to London from Bristol for the day by rail. Although the seats do not recline, I thought the leg room was fine. I have flown Ryanair several times over the years and have come to the conclusion that as long as you stick to the rules with regards checking in on line and adhere to luggage sizes, journeys are hassle free generally. Flight was late on the return leg but they emailed an apology before the dedicated check in time. That didn’t bother me personally. Their website is designed to capture more money related to seat allocation, earlier checkin, luggage upgrades, insurance, etc etc but they are optional and as long as you know what you want, there is no obligation to increase the price of your journey. I find their website and online check in very easy to use. I’m a pensioner and I’m grateful Ryanair offers fares at great value.",Ryanair

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Leeds to Faro,October 2023,3.0,4.0,,,,4.0,5,yes,9," Play the game and you'll be fine. Got a return flight from Leeds Bradford to Faro for £101. I booked 3 months ahead, didn't reserve a seat, and took only a small bag. Had my boarding pass both on my app, and in paper format (just in case). Took my own food and drink on the plane, didn't buy any of theirs, and didn't buy any of their duty free etc. It really does pay to do your research. At Leeds Bradford someone had lost their boarding pass (I think that cost them £60), while at Faro someone's cabin bag was too big. That had to go in the hold, and I expect that cost him. He said it was OK at Leeds, but maybe he got away with it there. My old bag would have been too big, but I checked Ryanair's website, and bought a new and conforming bag for £9.99. I'm 6 foot tall, and the leg room is tight, but just about OK for a 3 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable though and needed more cushioning. The outward flight took off and arrived on time. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. No hard sales pitch for food, drink, duty free. The announcements could have been clearer, but that was down to the Portuguese captain. The return flight was about an hour late taking off, due to delays experienced earlier in the day. This happens. Allow for it. They made up 20 minutes and the plane landed at Leeds Bradford 40 minutes behind schedule. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever and fantastic value for money. I'd reckon that the negative views on here are hugely in the minority. In some cases things have gone wrong, but in others part of the blame must be with the posters who haven't researched and prepared well.",Ryanair

However, often flying with Ryanair is a tiring thing. The boarding process can simply be a pain as between scanning your pass and effectively letting you on the plane they let passengers stand in line for long time, often in cramped places. Surely it is to assure everyone is there, can board quickly and enable the closing of the doors of the plane on time, but is quite a torture (many other airlines try to avoid such thing, probably with more differentiation of boarding groups). Furthermore, on this specific flight, the crew truly was a pain trying to sell all kind of “Duty Free” (non existing, as it was a domestic flight) items. The announcements took a full 10 minutes on a 60 min flight (sum it up with the safety instructions, buy on board of catering items, pilot’s message(s) etc), reading out all kind of “special offers” for more or less low ranking articles and was loud. Most “refined marketing action” was the seat belts sign to be turned on, for no reason whatsoever (quiet flying conditions), to assure proper sales of articles.",Ryanair

Want to cancel your reservation within 24h from the purchase? Not possible. Need some time to choose which luggage you'll need? Be ready to pay double price for that, right after the booking. Want to change your flight? Double price just for the fees. They are tracking everything you do in their app to show you higher prices wherever they can.

Flawless job. All four flights were pleasantly uneventful, departure and arrival strictly on time (that was especially crucial for me because I needed to take a bus for a consequent journey and a late arrival could be an issue). Very quick check-in and boarding (almost no queues), I'm being amazed with such efficiency of processes again and again. And, of course, really cheap prices (especially to Vilnius, they are even cheaper than bus tickets for the same route, but even to a summer holidays destination which Thessaloniki is, the prices are much more affordable than the competitors' ones).

Despite having no issues at check-in, we checked in our paid baggage and had four cabin bags for four passengers. However, we were forced to pay extra for a small suitcase because we were in the priority line after being called forward by the stewards. It was evident that they were struggling with the boarding process and thus opened both lines for everyone.

We eventually paid the money, received a tag, and the staff informed us that we would find the suitcase during check-in in Bratislava. None of this materialized. We were forced to paid 46EUR for a service that utterly failed. The way the stewards in Burgas communicated and coerced us was absolutely distasteful.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rabat to Rome,August 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,2.0,4,yes,6," I would like to point out that the airline is a 'Budget airline' and it's pretty popular in Europe and north Africa, and RYANAIR is the most well known of them all for various reasons (mostly negative). BOOKING AND CHECK-IN: To book your flight like every other airline you do it online, through their website or their own app, booking a flight is easy enough and the first thing that will surprise you is how cheap tickets can get, some goes for less than 20 Euros, and many of them don't go over 100 Euros (depending on when you're booking), although that's very good you soon realise why the airline is hated, as when you choose your ticket you're bombarded with fees left and right for everything else besides the ticket. You have a big bag you want to take with you? That would be 30€ extra. Want to bring a small cabin bag? You can only do that by buying priority Which is at least 25€...etc the only thing you can bring is one backpack for free that weighs less than 10kg. They also try to sell you on offers such as compensation etc, but for the most part it's absolutely not worth it, so don't spend your money on them. In terms of checking you can do it for free only when there's less than 24 hours left on the flight online, if you come to check in at the airport you'll be charged 30€ for them to check-in for you and give you the boarding pass, so keep that in mind! WAITING AND BOARDING: It's the day you take your flight! Remember that when you get through security, to look at the departures carefully, because 3 times out of ten they will change their gate (that's if they show you the gate early, they usually show it until there's less than an hour for the planes departure), stay alert! After that you during boarding you must wait until it's your turn (if you don't have priority) and go to your plane! In the boarding pass you printed or given they will tell you where to board, because Ryanair uses both the front and the rear for boarding people, and rarely use normal gates. After you've boarded, sit, relax if you can, because the seats aren't the best and they aren't reclinable. The food is also not free so if you want anything you have to pay (they also don't accept cash, only cards). END OF TRIP: And there you go, you've survived the trip with (hopefully) little to no extra money spent! All and all as much as this review is negative in many aspects, to be completely fair you get what you pay for, if you know what you're doing already and/or made research to be prepared you shouldn't have any problems! It's a very good airline for the fact they give such cheap tickets to people like me (a student) who can't afford ""big airlines"" and can go with only a backpack! It's also a different story if you go with your family or friends as in my situation all my flights in Ryanair were solo! Just watch out for their scummy behaviour to extract more money and try to not book the flight on third party websites. For me I'll give it a solid 6/10 because for many people like me the airline is a life saver, but it's definitely not for everybody to use.",Ryanair

The queues were quite long and they sent us to the wrong queue even I asked them politely to get in the right one. When we had only 1 hour left I thought we might miss our flight. We asked them for assistance but they didn’t do anything at all. Many staffs there were so tired and unhelpful. They didn’t send is any emails about the fees for checking in at the airport and we were charged £330 for it. Finally, we still missed our flight and had to be on ‘standby’ twice.

I booked my flights via booking.com and added check in luggage for 116$ on the airport I got told I appreciate don’t have any luggage included although showing him the extra luggage fee I paid via booking. He could apparently not find it and I had to pay my luggage again in the airport for 95Euro. I also got told that it’s mandatory when flying with Ryanair to online check in. Check in at the airport is only free if you are more then 2hour prior to the flight at check in desk. I arrived 2,5 prior my flight on the airport but I wasn’t on the desk till 1:50 prior. So I had to pay another 55 euro to be checked in.  When arriving on my gate there was a line for boarding. I had paid 20 euro extra for priority. I walked up to the desk and told one Ryanair woman that I had priority. She just said we called out priority 5-10 min ago if your weren’t coming forward then now you have to go back in line with the rest. This has been a absolute joke and disaster. ",Ryanair

Total waste of time and money paying for Priority Boarding when you have allocated seats Quick turn around meant aircraft hadn’t been cleaned. Crisps and biscuits all over the floor around the seat. Normal crew members more interested in selling food and lotto tickets rather than concentrating on safety.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Venice,October 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4,no,2," We took Ryanair for all of our flights within Europe. 3/4 of flights were OK except that they were all at least 1 hour late. I was OK with this and was expecting this based on their reputation. On our flight from Berlin to Venice, we were re-routed and had to land in Verona about 1.5 hours from Venice (Treviso) due to a major storm. Ryanair has no ground staff to assist people which is why they can be 'budget'. We landed late at night and 3 other Ryanair flights also landed in Verona due to the storm. There was a very nice lady employed by Verona Airport who was helping all the Ryanair customers. We were told to wait for buses arranged by Ryanair to take people from Verona to Treviso airport. People were fighting to get on the buses and we didn't understand why anyone would behave that way, considering Ryanair must surely know exactly how many buses they need to send based on how many flights/passengers had landed. Well, we were wrong. We also felt we should have been the last to go on the bus since all 3 other planes had landed before us and waited much longer. There were 40 people still left and we were told that the last bus was coming but it could fit only 16 people. Ryanair informed the airport over the phone that they would reimburse taxi fares for the remaining people. I am here to tell you that after months of back-and-forth email communication with Ryanair, they notified us that they do not need to reimburse us for a natural calamity since it's not their fault. I understand that's their policy, but I wish we were not misled to believe that the taxi cost would be reimbursed. If we had known what we know now, we could have taken a taxi as soon as we landed instead of waiting for 3 hours on the sidewalk outside of Verona airport. If you are flying with this airline, just hope that you don't end up with any special situation needing customer service, otherwise you are probably OK.",Ryanair

You can't bring a small hand luggage (only a backpack). You need to pay priority to bring a small hand luggage. I had a backpack, but on my way back they claimed that it was bigger than what was allowed. I did put it in their box, but they claimed it didn't quite fit. They charged me £80 for a backpack. They refused to accept cash and refused to accept apple pay. Even though I was willing to pay, they made no effort to help me and were ready to prevent me from boarding, unless I paid with a credit card. I gave them my credit card and they claimed that it wasn't accepted. I had to log into my bank account to show them that they took the money. They let me board seconds before the gate was closed. I asked for a receipt. Their printer was broken and they said they would email it to me. They didn't.

We were unable to check in online due to a Wi-Fi failure on the airport. We expected some consideration from the Ryanair-staff. After a rather unpleasant conversation we had to pay £100 for our boarding passes. But they only accepted credit cards which we didn't have. So we couldn't fly. Staff were ice-cold. That's how they are trained. Finally, a friend paid for us. But we had already missed our flight because of this. Now we had to rebook our tickets. Of course, again we received the emotionless treatment of the staff and an extra 200 pounds lighter, we were finally able to leave London Stansted Airport. Ryanair takes advantage of the fact people don't own a credit card, and they do this on purpose. It's just a low strategy to make a bit of extra money.",Ryanair
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Katowice to Dortmund,July 2023,3.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,4,"  Ryanair is as basic as cheap flying can get. Your initial costs seem low but you should add the price of an additional passenger to your calculations, in case anything will go wrong. We booked two flights over Ryanair. Dortmund to Katowice and vice versa. As all cheap airlines, Ryanair has strict measurements for the size of the luggage you're allowed to bring. While boarding the machine on the first flight, Dortmund to Katowice, our Luggage was measured by the ground and fit into the Ryanair restrictions. While boarding the flight back the very same luggage somehow did not fit into size regulations, and we were charged an additional 310 PLN (about 71,82€ at current rates) per piece of luggage. All that while other passengers that went by with visibly larger luggage were not asked to measure and could proceed to board unbothered by the ground staff. In addition, as we boarded the machine, the staff informed us that our Luggage would be too large to store it in the cabin, and had to be transported inside the cargo department of the plane. Which of course comes with extra waiting times at the airport. In addition, we booked a rental car at Katowice Airport over Ryanair. Of course, there where some problems with the booking and we had to cancel the booking and ended up paying about 70% more for the car as we initially would have.",Ryanair

They seem to be economical, but then you have to pay ridiculous add on fee even for a carryon. I went ahead and paid for a checked bag and a carryon (for each of us:2) because I didn't know what we would be traveling with. They send an email to check in the day before (like everyone) but also say you will be charged 30 euro if you don't check in online. The app is so confusing and chaotic. The record locator evidently doesn't indicate that you have already paid for luggage. There is no way to skip the screen (I was told later I should have just checked the box for undersea bag only for no charge) How was I supposed to know that? We both had suitcases and backpacks for overhead. So I had to pay again to even check in. I told them at the customer service desk what happened and gave my documentation showing I had paid twice. No refunds. Not under any circumstances. Boarding was late and chaotic. It was an awful and awfully expensive experience. Never again.",Ryanair
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to London ,May 2023,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My recent flight with Ryanair from Lisbon to Stansted turned into a nightmare due to the behavior of two specific crew members. Their actions made the journey highly inconvenient for my family and several other passengers. It seemed their main objective was to extract extra money from travelers for baggage, which created a tense and unpleasant atmosphere during boarding. The trouble began when a passenger in front of us was forced to pay for their bag, even though it appeared perfectly fine from our viewpoint. We voiced our concerns, hoping for some empathy from the crew member. Unfortunately, this only seemed to provoke them to target us next. On a hot day in Lisbon, we had placed our jackets in a foldable bag, adhering to the baggage policy. However, as we were being briefed on the rules, we put our jackets on. After a discussion with a colleague, the crew member allowed us to proceed. While in the queue, one of my daughters, who has asthma, removed her jacket and hat. Suddenly, the same crew member appeared, ordering us out of the line and threatening to deny us boarding. Despite explaining that nothing had changed since they had previously allowed us through, they remained stubborn. They called another crew member over, and both of them joined in a verbal assault. They disregarded the fact that the extra bags were gadgets belonging to my child and wife, insisting that we could only carry four bags. Their behavior was not only rude and disrespectful but also unprofessional, displaying personal animosity and complete disregard for our well-being. It was evident that this crew member was actively seeking an excuse to single us out and personally target us. Our attempts to explain were met with increasing firmness, dismissiveness, and even mockery. Their conduct left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing what should have been a smooth and stress-free journey. I am deeply disappointed that Ryanair employs individuals who lack professionalism and take their frustrations out on innocent customers. This experience was disheartening, leading me to question whether I would choose to fly with Ryanair in the future.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Brussels,February 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with Ryanair that left me disappointed and dissatisfied with their service. Despite it not being mandatory to complete web check-in for my flight, I was unjustly charged a hefty fee of 40EUR due to an error on their part. Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that I needed to pay the additional fee because I had not completed the web check-in process. However, according to Ryanair's own policy, web check-in is not mandatory, and passengers are still able to check in at the airport without incurring any charges. I found it incredibly unfair and frustrating that I was penalized for their own mistake. The customer service representative I approached for assistance was unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation. They showed no willingness to resolve the issue or provide any explanation for the unnecessary charge. This lack of professionalism only added to my dissatisfaction. As a frequent flyer, I have had positive experiences with several other airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and go above and beyond to rectify their mistakes. Unfortunately, Ryanair fell far short of these expectations. The incident left a sour taste in my mouth and has significantly impacted my perception of Ryanair as a reliable and customer-centric airline. The lack of transparency and the unwarranted charge have made me question their commitment to customer service and fairness. I strongly advise other travelers to be cautious when booking with Ryanair and to carefully review their policies and fees. It is disheartening to experience such disregard for customer satisfaction, and I hope that Ryanair takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their service and rectifying their mistakes. Overall, my experience with Ryanair was deeply disappointing, and I cannot recommend them based on the unjust charges and lack of accountability I encountered.",Ryanair

Ryanair disguises their prices as low, but they purposely try to trick you and find everything wrong with your booking when you are at the airport in order for you to pay extra fees (which you are forced to pay because you are desperate to get onto the flight). I first witnessed an older couple so excited to be on holiday but rudely told by the counter staff that they did not check in on time so they have to pay €100. I was saddened by this as the couple looked so old and were taken advantage. They make it very difficult to check in online (you can only do it within a ridiculous timeframe) so once again you are forced to pay the fees. The staff at the counters before boarding also treated my sister like a criminal because her bag was a little larger then regulations. Screaming at her and embarrassing her, it was so sad. This is not how people should be treated when they are happy to go on holiday and work very hard to get time off. I implored with the staff that there was no reason to be rude. To top it off, when we arrived in Athens, our friends suitcase was broken. I would not recommend Ryanair and it would be better off going with another airline even if it costs more as you end up paying more with Ryanair after the additional fees they trick you into paying once you are at the airport.",Ryanair

It was an excellent alternative to flying normal economy class being good value, good service with the comfort of a smaller cabin, bigger seats and priority check-in etc. The premium cabin has been renamed Scoot Plus some time ago but product remained the same. However, things appear to have changed. The cabin on this flight was dirty, the crew disinterested, the ""one"" complimentary drink served with the meal can no longer be a choice including wine/beer as you can only buy this as apparently the policy has changed and only water, soft drink, tea or coffee can be chose. I was informed I could only buy a wine when the Scoot Cafe opens. The meals were served immediately the flight reached cruising altitude and were being collected before I had even started. The lights were dimmed during the meal service and the crew disappeared. Other passengers started ringing the bell to order from the Scoot Cafe as it seems no trolley was going to appear. I thought selling food and drinks was the way to make money on these budget airlines! The crew freely allowed passengers from the back of the plane to use the one and only lavatory in the front of the premium cabin. I paid a lot of money for this flight for me, my wife and daughter (being the end of the school holidays in Australia) and was extremely disappointed in the standard of pretty much everything on this and another recent Scoot flight.",Scoot

I do not know about this and went to check in exactly 48h as per recommended thus was being assigned the worst seats ever. Non-reclined chair and near the toilet. The system is not smart enough to know that I'm travelling in group of 4 and to assign seats to us together thus I was assigned 3 seats in row 30 (right side of aircraft) and 1 seat in row 29 (left window seat of aircraft). I tried to change the seats by calling the call centre but they couldn't. The agent escalated my case and told me will return a call to me the next day for an update. However, she did not. So I decided to call back and found out that she had knocked off work for that day. I tried to communicate with other agents regarding my case but eventually it was still unresolved. Also, their manager was unhelpful and avoided clarifying my issues with me. He said that he would escalate the matter to HQ and will update by the end of his work shift. But he did not do so as well. This resulted in me calling the call centre serveral times as I could not reach the manager nor the first agent that handled my case. Eventually, when I spoke to 2 of his agents regarding my case, they hung up my call as they said that they couldn't assist me and had to attend to other customers. I was upset with how unprofessional they had attended to my seat flight case and the empty promises that the agents said they will return me a call but no one had ever returned a call to me until I persisted in my callings to reach one of them. However, I'm grateful that when I approached the check in counter staff during my departure, the front counter staff managed to change the seats as there were still available seats on the flight.

Another agent also claims that ""its a secret that the system assigned starting from the last row"". I told the agent its unfair to not make this known to customers especially when its a common understanding that last row seats are one of the worst seats to sit. My conversations with Scoot lasted even till 29 Dec and little resolution was given. Scoot kept delaying my issue and I believe this is one of their tactic to shun the customer away.

I chatted with one staff on the chat option from Singapore. Said she will ""escalate"" the matter immediately and I will get a reply in 3 days.

Informed them that Scoot was the one who promised this, and it was their responsibility to get one. I kept repeating myself so many times. It was clear that the person speaking to me on the phone was lacking the understanding language of simple English. Once again, the same incident happened in Melbourne. No wheelchair.

It even looks like Spirit as both airlines are that ugly banana yellow color. First, their website showed the flight as sold out, but I was able to book online, but they charge you an extra fee to book online. Yes, this company charges extra just to sell you a ticket. Then the flight was very late. We didn't board until after the official cut off time for boarding had actually passed. Once onboard, the flight attendants were rude and curt. Then, they couldn't get the plane off the ground, so on top of being 30 minutes late, they couldn't take off for nearly another hour. So the plane finally took off well over an hour late. Most ridiculous, was that the seat next to me was empty, and I set my jacket on that seat. The flight attendant made me remove my jacket from the seat for takeoff, and also remove my headphones. No US carrier makes you remove your headphones for takeoff. Is this an Asian thing, or are they that challenged that they think that is an effective safety measure. Lastly, this seat is so uncomfortable, it is curved so much my spine feels like it is doing the Cow yoga pose. This is a terrible airline and I would never fly it again.

Upon check-in, I was met by a stern and unfriendly ground staff member, and that unfriendliness continued with the ground staff handling the boarding gate. They looked depressed, pressured, and tired as if they hated their job. However, once on board, the team of flight attendants changed the mood of the flight. They ensured everyone was well looked after with their positive attitude throughout the flight. The seats gave me extra few inches of legroom and were surprisingly comfortable. That, combined with the A320NEO's new cabin feel, was a perfect recipe for a clean, comfortable, and awesome flight. The in-flight entertainment was rich in content and easy to use, however, being a Wi-Fi-based entertainment used by many people on the flight, the signal strength was incredibly weak. That, and the less-than-good ground staff team at Yogyakarta, were the only two things preventing this flight from getting a solid 10/10. The landing was around 10 minutes ahead of schedule, and the ground staff team in Singapore quickly arranged our bags at a special spot thanks to the long immigration queue in Singapore. Low-cost flying can be identic with no-frills yet dismaying service, lousy products, and pay-tons-of-bucks-for-everything.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Melbourne via Singapore ,June 2023,2.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I am the last person to complain about cheap airlines. You get what you’re paying for, so I am not really expecting great perks, comfort, or customer service as long as they get me safely to my destination. That’s the deal. However, I won’t stand dishonest and cheating businesses and Scoot is a great example of that. On my last trip with them, I was told upon checking in, that I had 11 euro credit on my account and the lady at the counter was not able to give me my ticket till I pay. She did not tell me what this payment was for (I asked, but she didn’t know) and redirected me to the cashier (who was supposed to give me all the details). There, again, I was told that he didn’t know any details of the payment (“sort this out directly with the airline”), just that I need to pay. So 2 hours before my flight to Australia I was running back and forth between two Scoot desks to find out what was this about with no luck, no one gave me any info. I was naïve enough to think that this was probably just a system issue – I gave up and paid, I thought I would resolve the issue with customer service afterward. Wow, how stupid I was. I sent the refund request via Scoot website explaining the situation. I got the reply that the charge was for the seat selection, which I apparently requested and on which I was apparently informed. So, now I am on my 5th complaint email, saying that I have never requested a seat and they are saying that I had. I ended up paying for the service I have never received, and they do not even have the decency to take responsibility for their mistakes.",Scoot

For some reason people could bring in multiple carry-on luggages and were allowed to use other seats' overhead compartments, causing massive delays as flight crew had to re-stow luggage into cargo for other passengers who rightfully had the compartments for their own use. Did the counter crew not check boarding passengers and allowed one person to bring in not only 2 suitcases but also multiple bags? We had a Karen who not only used one full compartment for her 4 bags of souvenirs, but still had the gall to demand crew to leave her suitcases with her when they were trying to stow them into cargo. Cabin crew is trying their best, but people are extremely inconsiderate so maybe have more stringent checks. It has been almost 25 minutes delay now due to counter checking incompetence and flight has still not hit the runway. Do not recommend.",Scoot

This was yet another flight that was rescheduled without advice to us by Scoot. Our original booking would have seen us travel from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore to Perth in the course of a day rather than have an enforced stopover of 18 hours in Singapore which allowed time to eat, bathe and sleep before returning to the airport. Boarding was disorganised and the flight was delayed upon departure by about an hour. Our pre booked seats were changed without advice and we ended up four rows from the toilets at various times there was the overpouring stench of stale urine in the cabin. both my partner and I used the toilets and prior to her being able to use them she had to do a clean with disinfectant wipes and tissues. Disgraceful it reflects poorly on the airline, cabin crew and our fellow passengers personal hygiene practices. None of our flights with Scoot departed on schedule each flight was re scheduled without notification to us. What is unfortunate about this experience is part of our decision was based upon past travel with Singapore Airlines, Scoots parents company. It is not a good look to be associated with such a poorly operated and managed low cost carrier who has little care or concern for its passengers. In Singapore Airlines case its association with Scoot is a race to the bottom. Scoot is little more than riding a public bus.",Scoot

We were re scheduled to Scoot TR 307 some 6 hours later as a consequence we were faced with an 18 hour layover in Singapore which wasnt what we wanted or needed. Queries to Scoot about the changes and lack of notification are ignored they dont respond to customer enquiries. The boarding at Ho Chi Minh was confusing there was an unannounced gate change and the flight dissapeared from the nominated gate.

Our flight TR423 experienced a delay of approximately one hour due to an inbound flight delay. Upon our arrival at the Singapore airport, the crew members on TR423 requested that we move to the front seats in order to facilitate a quicker disembarkation. I would like to extend my appreciation to those Scoot crew members for their assistance. However, upon reaching Gate 35 at 2:20 am, I encountered two Scoot ground members who not only failed to provide us with directions to the gate as expected, but also informed us, along with five other passengers on the same route, that we were not allowed to proceed to the TR18 gate. Instead, they insisted that we go to terminal 3 to catch the Singapore Airlines flight SQ207 to Melbourne. During this time, one of the passengers was chatting with a friend on TR18 via WeChat and was informed that the TR18 flight was still at the gate, with the door open and waiting for us. We immediately conveyed this information to the Scoot ground members, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. Shockingly, despite being aware of the situation, the two ground members adamantly refused our request and directed us to the SATs Lounge. When I inquired about the refund for the Economy to Economy Plus seat upgrade that I had paid for, I was simply told to contact Scoot online for assistance. As a result of their refusal, the doors of TR18 closed promptly at 2:55 am, preventing me from boarding the flight.",Scoot

Had we not done an online check in we would have arrived at the airport and missed the rescheduled flight. At no time were we made aware of the changes either by Scoot or Flight Centre. Nor were we advised that our return flights from Ho Chi Minh had also been substantially altered so that what should have been a 2 hour transit became an 18 hour transit. More on that later. The flights were 2 hours late departing we were given some sort of child’s gift pack as compensation. Attempts to raise the matter have seen many emails sent without a plausible response. They now deny there was a booking at all and no longer respond. Just another junk low cost carrier, pity it’s backed by Singapore Airlines it reflects badly on them.

And every time they respond, they would keep asking the same set of documents which I already submitted. So approximately 4 months now and I haven’t received anything from them.

The points apply to all legs of the journey, although the long haul Berlin-Singapore and back is clearly more significant and determines the rating. Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water. If you know real quality airlines, what Scoot delivers is a huge disappointment. On the return flight SIN-BER, the folding tables (several in my row) were so dirty. I guess they have not been cleaned for a long time. Thank god I had disinfectant and a cloth with me. Yikes, Scoot! In summary, it must be said that the customer at Scoot is apparently only there to flush money into the company. There is no question of appreciation of the flight guests. These flights fall into the category: There is no second chance for a first impression. We flew exactly twice with Scoot, the first and the last time. I would rather spend a little more money on a real, good airline than fly long-haul with Scoot again. For short-haul (up to about 3 hours, it's ok).",Scoot

Now, in Apr 2023, I finally received an outcome from them, only to be told that they cannot give me a refund nor the merchandise as ‘all items were claimed on the flight’.

It was the worst long trip of my life. I had to take 2 flights with scoot, from Manila to Berlin with stop in Singapore. The first one (Manila to Singapore) was just a couple of hours so it was ok, although it arrived delayed, so I had to run to catch my connection. The second flight from Singapore to Berlin should last 13 hours. I thought this plane would be much bigger an comfortable than the one before, but it was exactly as bad. It could fit more passengers, but everything was exactly as narrow. I would get no pillow, no blanket, no screen with movies, no food, not even a glass of water! I never experienced something like this on an intercontinental flight, I thought it was not even allowed. You could of course buy something but totally overprice, like a small cola for 5 euros. Honestly, low cost has gone too far. The seats were as small as the ones of a 2 hours Ryanair flight, but for 13 hours. In addition, it was so unfortunate that I had to sit in the very last row, in which you couldn’t put the chair back, not even just 1 cm.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Singapore to Gold Coast,July 2022,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I flew Soot Plus (slightly better than economy) on 24 July 2022 from Singapore to Gold Coast. This fare is more than three times the price of a standard seat as it is more spacious, greater reclining capability and a footrest. When I boarded the plane, there were two Defect notices (see attached) on my seat indicating that: 1. the reclining mechanism was defective and the seat would not tilt. 2. the head rest was defective and not operational. From 10:00pm until about 8:00am (an 8 hour period allowing for local time) I had to sit in a fully upright position in this seat with the defective ripped headrest that could only be partially used. I appreciate that the plane was fully booked and therefore I could not be moved to another seat. Cabin crew told me with sincerity that they would submit a report on the problem. It has now been just short of 4 months since I lodged my complaint to Scoot with no offering of a resolution. I have contacted Scoot on 2 occasions (which is a near impossible feat) since July and was told that it would be processed within a week. It is a direct deliberate lie? I have since written to the parent company Singapore Airline. They did not respond. If flying Between Australia and Asia do not fly Scoot. They are near impossible to contact and they do not care. And there is no complaint mechanism within Australia. A bargain is a bargain until you get stung. I have just contacted Scoot again and they have advised me that the case is closed. They haven't even reviewed or contacted me.  All complaints are just closed as they are received.",Scoot

Overall, the travel experiences have not been satisfactory. Recently, we paid for extra leg room seats 4D and 4C when the tickets were purchased online. When we checked in physically at the counter, the boarding pass were issued accordingly. However, after boarding the flight to Bangkok minutes just before the plane took off, the airline staff requested us to vacate the seats and move to the back row seats as though they did not know we had paid for front extra leg room seas (I shown them the receipts and boarding pass). Despite having secured 2 extra leg room seats as indicated in the boarding pass. Different staff appeared and indicated that the plane has been changed last minute and the current seats belonged to Scootplus and we must move to row 31 and 32. She took our boarding pass and use pen to amend the boarding pass seat number. We paid additional additional fare of SGD 190 for 2 to remain in Scootplus and requested for the refund of SGD 54 for extra leg rooms seats (2). After 2 weeks, still no news although the hotline said they would investigate and revert. The experience was certainly not something we cherished. It was ok to change plane due to unforeseen circumstances but refund should be made for overpayment. For any underpayment, we were happy to top up as well. Earlier experience to Penang also did not end well as date change of ticket online in the portal were not very smooth, very hard to make date change during May - June 2022 (the price differentials for flight/date change were much higher than buying a new ticket).

A drink of water was offered in the first hour before a plastic covered menu was passed around, only two meals were available.

It was cancelled because of the crisis. We got a voucher and thought we could fly Scoot Plus business class with the voucher later. The voucher was only a substitute for a refund that we were entitled to.  This is not the case with Scoot. When we booked the replacement flight, there was only Business Class in a Boeing on the route from Bangkok to Singapore, on the return flight only Economy due to a different aircraft and we had to pay extra for excess baggage, for the seat and for boarding first. In total, we paid 47%  extra for worse conditions. On the outward flight, everything worked okay. Scoot cannot organise an immigration fast track for Business Class customers. Long before the trip, we received an email that the departure time had changed. The reason for this was another change of aircraft back to Boeing. That there was now a Business Class after all was not disclosed. At check-in, we were given an Eco ticket in the last row of the plane, although we had been confirmed seats in the first row and had paid a surcharge for them. There was no mention of the paid first boarding. Only after a massive protest the check-in manager gave us seats a little further forward. We were told that Business Class was fully booked. Arriving at the gate, we found an inadequate small waiting room in which the passengers had to wait standing up like sardines in a can. I asked a Scoot employee for a seat and received a shrug.

We had to book another connecting flight and accommodation, and lost a day off of our holiday in addition to lost money with our existing accommodation. The customer service was pathetic with no complaints department or management to speak to. Completely apathetic response and no care whatsoever.

They lost my bag for a week and offered me ZERO help to get it back - I eventually got it back through my own efforts by making dozens of expensive calls every day for a week to the ground staff at the relevant airports. It was extremely stressful. Every time I asked for help from Scoot, if I actually got through which was rare, the person on the end of the phone said it was not their role to help with that and could not even direct me towards someone who could. I filed a claim for compensation for the expenses incurred in the week without my luggage (not to mention the stress of it!) and two months have gone by and they are still ignoring my emails.

Trapped in the airport transit for 14 hours. I don't expect much from a low fare airline, but the way the handle their customers is not satisfactory. Our flight from Singapore to London via Bangkok, and according to my booking confirmation, we would remain seated for the short stop in BKK. In reality we landed in Bangkok, everyone had to leave the plane, go through security and then back into the plane 30 mins later. Then we sat there in the plane for 1 hour without much information before the pilot tells us that the plane (787) is not airworthy due to a mechanical error, and they need to organise a new plane. Then we were given a voucher for food and told that a new plane was set up at 8pm, then they said 11pm, then 12am (14 hours later). Everyone had to leave the plane, go through security before scrambling to figure out what to do next. According to their website ""when a flight has been delayed (retiming is the word they use) by more than 4 hours, we have 3 choices: voucher, refund or change flight date."" Fair enough, I want to change the date. But according to airport information, there is no Scoot counter or Scoot staff in the airport until 12 hours later, so calling Scoot is the only possibility other than waiting 12 hours. So I call Scoot twice, because the first operator got disconnected and I have no way of getting back to him, so I have to queue 10 mins again. After explaining that the plane I'm waiting 14 hours for is not currently up in the air, but is in fact delayed (they were clueless and kept on insisting that I must be on the plane, in the air), they would not allow me to change or cancel my flight. Why? Because I am in transit, and if I wanted a refund/change, I should have done it before taking off from Singapore (I obviously didn't know the plane was going to be delayed back then, and I was even told we would not disembark in Bangkok). I ask the airport information counter, and they insist that because there is no Scoot staff at the airport, I cannot leave the airport. ",Scoot

I missed my connecting flight to London via Singapore Airlines! The worst part was neither Scoot nor Singapore Airlines took responsibility for what happened. I along with 5 other passengers in the same flight were left to fend and find out what we need to do on our own once we landed in Singapore, we were not given any instructions and the customer service was atrocious! After finding out that 4 of us will have to wait 12 plus hours after being placed on standby no help, explanation nor accommodation were offered! If I did not demand for accommodation, which I was still not given, I would not have been offered access to one of the lower level lounges!

Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu. They did not have it. Do not book Spicejet flights even if you’re getting them for free.

There were murmurs among passengers about SpiceJet's limited staffing and flights, suggesting that they might be playing games with travelers.

I had taken this evening flight to Calcutta, during the web check-in, I had opted for the random seat selection for which there would be no charges applied as I was travelling solo, so before 12 hours of the departure, I had received the seat. Check-in was done at the old T1 terminal at BOM where baggage drop was done swiftly as there was no line and queues which was surprising. The boarding started on time however I noticed that when I was about to greet the crew there were 2 crew members who were not really greeting any of the passengers and seem surprised that I wished them good evening when they reciprocated. Ideally greeting the passengers is something that should be standard. Also I noticed that the load on this flight was on the lighter side as well however due to the ATC clearances the actual pushback and departure was delayed by over 1 hour but this was not on the airline. The pilots did a good job of keeping the passengers updated about the reasons for the delay. The flight itself was operated on one of those Boeing 737-800NG aircraft that was painted in the erstwhile JetConnect liveries. The pilots tried to make the time en route on the flight and was able to retrieve my luggage soon without waiting too long. While Spicejet has been going through a lot of difficulties in recent times, and that was also reflected in the manner in which the crew seemed disinterested in greeting the passengers, there are still small things that the airline can do which can still make a small difference to the passenger experience because otherwise for the fare that was paid this was a decent functional experience that was able to get me safely to my destination.",SpiceJet

Such conduct from Spicejet was very unprofessional and dissatisfactory. When a customer pays the ticket price, he owns the right to travel through the flight and taking away this right is illegal in all terms. I cannot understand if there is a policy of spicejet to charge amounts for a laptop bag, what made the team cancel my onboarding on the request of adding these 2 words - ""Laptop Bag"" on the excess baggage charge payment receipt. To my utmost surprise, when I raised this with Spicejet, they are saying that I have only refused to travel and they did not deny onboarding. This is completely false, as any sensible person can vouch for it - if I would have to refuse travel I would not have even paid the excess baggage charges in the first instance.

Adding to the distress, the staff demanded an exorbitant additional charge for our luggage, including an unreasonable claim for my baby's stroller, which we had previously taken on the same route without any problems during our outbound flight. This inconsistency and unjustified charge left us deeply dissatisfied. Despite providing proof of double payment, SpiceJet is yet to refund the excessive amount they charged us under duress. It is disheartening to see an airline of this stature failing to provide basic customer satisfaction.

Now 2 days back I received an SMS from SpiceJet that the flight has been cancelled and there is no alternative flight available. I spoke to SpiceJet agent and requested them to arrange a flight for me on another carrier which is Indigo on which I was told that I need to write to higher authorities. This is plainly making a fool out of the customer as now the only direct flight which is available is Indigo and is more than double the price I paid for SpiceJet flight booked in advance. SpiceJet always does this with their customers. If they are unable to operate they should shut down operations but shouldn’t cheat the customers.

It was supposed to reach around 10. We had an onwards journey to Shillong. When we tried to check in, we realised that flight has changed to evening 19.00 hrs.

While we tried checking in previous day, we learnt that flight time has changed to 23.30 hrs. And reaching back at 3.00am the next day. We had no choice as other airline flights were not available for 3 people or exorbitantly expensive. We had to continue and checked in. The flight was delayed from scheduled 23.30 hrs on 21st May to 00.45am on 22nd May. We have landed on T2 terminal at 4.20am. We have lost sleep, money and an entire of work day pre travel and post travel. We have barely slept. They have offered a sandwich and Rajma Chawl at the airport.

The web check in for the flight was fine and I had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection. So the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure. The check in and baggage drop was smooth. The boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route. Noted that I was flying on a 737 Max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated. Also the plane was much quieter. However when boarding, most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual. Also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket, the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary. The safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin. It felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through. Perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment. It is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named SpiceScreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge. It had a decent selection of movies / podcasts / magazines which was much appreciated. The flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately. On the whole, for the cheap fare that was paid, the service was what was expected and it's true that even though the airline is going through challenges, there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of.",SpiceJet

You will never find a more boorish, crude and unreasonable airline like them, they kept me at Mumbai Airport for almost 10 hrs, no remorse even for our loss, the important meeting I missed, the expenses I had to endure in these 10 hrs in the airport and complete wastage of time.

I want my money right now in 1 day in fact in 5 minutes the way you looted it while SpiceJet looted it while they gave an illusion for a service. I wonder why the Indian aviation authorities and customer services are not looking in such malpractices.",SpiceJet
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737 Max 8 ,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Delhi ,October 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," The worst flight I have flown with, airline has no sense of responsibility towards their customer satisfaction and they don’t value their time. I have taken a return trip flight with SpiceJet and both the times the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours. No communication was sent by the airline. When I asked one of assistant boarding staff to give the email ID of their supervisor, she clearly said that she don’t know the ID and during the flight the cabin crew were not co-operative. SpiceJet is very frequent in news for their delays and flight issues, still no actions are taken from their side. I think the Managing Director and his team should look into this or else SpiceJet should restrict their business to India and close their international flights.",SpiceJet

The flight time being around an hour. SpiceJet calls me a day prior to inform the flight is cancelled and I have to take an alternate flight (Goa - Delhi) (Delhi - Hyderabad) the flight time including lay over is more than 10 hours.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Ahmedabad to Delhi,September 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  It is a shame that companies like this are still allowed to operate. The flight was announced with delay and there is nothing you can do. They mention to you one hour delay so that you don’t freak out but at the end you don’t know when you are flying. On top of that you as very rude staff that really doesn’t care about customer satisfaction. If you ask to be booked on an earlier flight even with another airline they laugh at you. Never again and I advise all visitors to India to avoid them. They lie to you with a smile and they keep you sitting on the side until you break up,SpiceJet

First time booking a flight with Transavia. 6 hours before the flight I receive a message saying that my flight is cancelled due to a technical problem. Ok, happens. I had an important, urgent medical appointments on July 7th and 8th morning (thanks to those appointments a surgery was planned). The problem had to be solved immediately, so I contacted them via What'sApp, replies took time, I decided to call them. The call lasted 38 minutes. They offered me 3 solutions : Another flight on for 13th of July. Doesn't work for me. Reimburse my ticket,  but doesn't solve my problem. Get another flight from another company.  Yes, but the condition was to ""find a new ticket with a reasonable price close to the initial one"". To be more precise, I paid 98€, they told me I should find something under 150€. If you book a flight the same day, of course all the prices are going to be high! So taking into account the high prices of flights for that day, the service agent made me understand that I won't be fully reimbursed, therefore I'll have to pay extra money. I could finally find a flight for 198€, sent a mail and I'll see if they pay it. An overall opinion is horrible. I had feeling they were mocking me offering a solution which wasn't a solution at all even thought I explained the importance of being in Paris for me. I'll try to avoid this company in the future as much as I can. The only positive point is the service agent who was adorable, really understood my problem and tried to help me, but couldn't do it due to her limits. ",Transavia

No one knew where it actually was or cared. There was no one at Transavia to help us. No one knew where his bag was. When we were at the airport to leave we went to talk to someone who told us his bag was still in PARIS! We went to talk to another person about who to contact in Paris and they actually had his bag, In a hallway, in Rome and no one knew it was there.

We were in Disneyland resort, they expected us to go on 2 hour 30 mins notice to catch the flight and end our holiday 1 day early. How on earth would it have even been possible to catch that flight on 2 hour notice when it takes that time to get to the airport from our location in Paris! Then to top it all off they wanted us to pay for our own flight after they messed us about. Finally after 4 hours of our hotel manager dealing with the airline they rebooted our flight for the next day, the day after strikes for free. I needed to pay hotel for the extra night and on top of it all taxico the company we prepaid our taxi to the airport would not refund us or amend our collection time, nothing, Nada, just we understand but cannot do anything this is our 24 hour cancel policy.

When booked through KLM it is not possible to check-in online, although Transavia is a subsidiary of KLM/Air France. In communication with both airlines generic responses are given and no help is offered. That meant an early start to the airport to queue for check-in. It might be a blast from the past to some travelers, but I find this plain silly. Having stated the corporate inability, it has to be mentioned that ground and flight staff were really nice. Food and drinks for purchase are average for low budget carrier. As always for Transavia, leg space is a serious issue - just way too cramped.

I kinda liked the green leather though some may find it a bit garish. Most reviews not great but I found them fine. On time crews were again really friendly and polite, worked hard to help passengers find luggage space . Also special mention to the Transavia guy in Seville who noticed my lad had a football he had purchased. He told us it needed to be deflated a little to compensate for aircraft pressure. We had nothing to deflate it with but he asked a lady in the check in queue for her hair clip and then spent 10 minutes using this to get it deflated - much to the amusement of the waiting passengers!

We had two hours for the connection in Paris, which was tight since we had to retrieve our luggage and register them again. This was very clear from the beginning when I bought the tickets, so no question about it. Because of chaotic conditions in Corfu (widely understaffed for the first big summer vacation week end since Covid), we departed 2 hours late. The captain was good at communicating about the situation. I inquired with the cabin crew about my very short connection. Since I purchased the extra insurance to cover any travel interruption  he told me that their mission was to take us and our luggage to the final destination. As we were flying over Italy, the captain was able to communicate with the ground crew in Paris about our situation, the cabin crew checked our boarding pass for next flight, asked me about the color, size and brand of our luggage. We deboarded the plane and waited  outside the plane door as the cleaning crew was inside. Ground crew personally confirmed our luggage has been identified and was staying inside the plane. We then started boarding again with the new flight crew.

I will never book with this company again and urge others not to also. A company that has no decency should be boycotted because these companies abuse our trust and take our hard earned money for absolutely nothing. That’s not the way this world should be.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seville to Amsterdam,May 2022,1.0,3.0,,,,1.0,2,no,2,"  Flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process. We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight (at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards, but WTH?) The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result, the entire passenger queue, already after passing the passes control, has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without). I've even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now I'm writing this from home with severe back pain that I've experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference, the specific plane was PH-HZX. Curiously enough, the first flight (AMS-SVQ) didn't have these issues - the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport, but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway. In any case, now my stance towards the airline is never again, unless I'm really forced to.",Transavia
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Amsterdam,April 2022,2.0,4.0,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: ""I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what?

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Rennes,April 2022,,,,,,,3,no,3,"  It was going to be my first flight with this airline, and I was looking forward having this experience, as they belong to AF/KL group and have many flights in Europe. A couple of weeks after buying my non-refundable ticket, they canceled the flight. They offered a new flight, that was not suitable to me, as well a the refund option, that I chose. They inform they would refund within 2 weeks. The following weeks, they went on sending the same information about flight cancelation, and I could check my reservation had not been cancelled. They did not refund me. Suddenly i received an email remembering check-in policies. Therefore I called their ""service center"", that was quick to answer. They indeed then cancelled my reservation, and said I would receive a refund within 2 weeks. Immediately after my call, I received an email from Transavia stating that I had decided to cancel a non-refundable reservation, and therefore would not be allowed to refund. I called again, and they said they kind-of fixed it. Then I received an email, informing of a refund on process. So far, no money; I understand that airline suffers from financial troubles. However, I wonder how they intend to survive being non-ethical. They are cutting the branch where they are sitting. Air travel is a matter of trust. We trust that we are dealing with safe and honest service provider. If they fail in being fair with us, it is the whole image which is damaged.",Transavia

Just experienced a two hour delay due to a late arriving aircraft and there was no communication from the airline, nothing on the airport screens, and no information available through the app or flight tracking sites. Even the delayed incoming flight could not be found. When arriving at Orly, the buses us into a non-Schengen gate, where we all had to go through passport control despite this being a Schengen area flight. Bags also took a long time to be delivered. The crew is nice, but the seats are cramped and the cabin was filthy. The fare we paid was the same as Air France on the same route, even though it’s sold on the same website, belies the complete lack of services. I will avoid this airline in the future.",Transavia
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Keflavik,January 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,3,no,3,"  On the day 12th of January 2022, we had a flight from Amsterdam to Reykjavik at 16:45 - Flight HV 6887. This flight was canceled due the weather conditions in Iceland. In order to enter Iceland, we had to do an antigen test prior 72h the entry to the country. Our country of origin was Spain, where we paid €40 for two antigen tests, then we spent two days in Amsterdam and everything was planned in order to have the test still valid to travel to Iceland. Obviously we never took into consideration that our flight was going to be canceled and since that happened, we asked to a lady at Transavia’s counter if we had to repeat the test and her answer was “no, your test will still be valid”. The next day, when we managed to get to Schiphol Airport, we went again to ask at the Transavia’s counter to make sure if we had to do the test, and this time the answer was “yes, otherwise you might not be able to enter in Iceland”. So we repeated the test, which cost us €116. I emailed them that the fact that we had to repeat the test wasn’t our fault and if there was any chance to get a refund, and I didn’t get an answer in more than two months, the first email I sent was on the 13th of January, then again on the 21st of January (no answer from them) and again out the 15th of March, when I’ve been told that they couldn’t do anything because the flight was canceled due the weather conditions. What upsets me the most is the fact that two of their operators gave me two different answers, I’ve never got any apologies from them about this whole situation and they took more than two months to give me an answer. The final answer I’ve got was after five days that I’ve sent them the second reminder. They don’t seem to care much about their customers and it seems that they’re not really trained to deal with a situation like the one I had, this shows their lack of professionalism and it’s the reason why I will never travel with them again.",Transavia

Cabin crew friendly enough but did nothing to enforce covid regulations. I was seated opposite a customer with her unmasked nose on display and it remained like that for the rest of the flight. She wasn't the only one and cabin crew said nothing to anyone. They spent most of the flight hiding behind a curtain. The aircraft was also disgustingly dirty and had obviously been in this state for some time. Transavia also refuse to take cash which means you need to have a card they accept to buy any of their low quality, overpriced refreshments.

Lost baggage and then no help. First time flyer with Transavia and wouldn’t again. The flight itself was fine, nice plane although maybes a little dirty and lovely flight staff. If something goes wrong though you’re on your own. My checked suitcase didn’t leave the airport with us and it took 7 days before they found it. Now an unclaimed large suitcase sitting in an airport for 7 days just wouldn’t happen. I assume that they don’t make any effort and wait for someone else to ask if the luggage is one of their passengers. Once found now on my 3rd week and back home, we’re no where near getting our belongings back. I’m being told to wait with no approximate timescale such as days, weeks, months before they can get it back to me. I’m not even sure I’ll get it back. And as others have said, claiming expenses for essentials while you’re on holiday with none of your belongings is met with misplaced emails that miraculously appear after a lengthy phone call. Then you get a response asking for more information. Come on Transavia, mistakes happen which aren’t in your control but you don’t need to do much to make your customers feel cared for.

This is now 10 to 6. The monitor showed they are still boarding and terminal one in Schiphol isn’t big. No one gave us warnings even tho they claimed they did.  Meanwhile the screens still say boarding. We walk over to customer service, they were telling us we can’t board we can clearly see calls for boarding than final call. Easy could have made. Worst case scenario we won’t get it and I still have to buy a second ticket. Which we did but not by them cuz they said they they didn’t have any but we found tickets tickets cheaper on another site for way cheaper. I paid 330 euro one way. This cost me 200 for me and my gf.

Little did we know they are notorious to tell you once you are onboard, you are going to fly to another island to pick up more passengers (making up excuses that another flight on that island had a long inspection). So now we are traveling for two hours longer. Two take offs two landings, sitting on the plane while they pack up the flight to a max, then refuel).

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Thessaloniki,May 2021,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I arrived at checkin at 08.30 with the flight departing at 9.15. The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid.  I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules. Bouncing off people like that might be ok if we are talking about trains or buses because you can catch the next one. I would expect airline employees to be a little more considerate especially during those times. ",Transavia

I told the ground staff that the website had indicated it was possible, which is the reason for us booking. This resulted in some confusion but we managed to get the seats that we paid for eventually. This is the 2nd time that Transavia had shifted us without consent, and both times, we had to rectify. I think that shifting passenger seats without prior consent is highly unprofessional as this is preventing people from getting what they paid for. Onboard, the exit row had decent leg room.

Finally, Vistara today accepted that they haven't processed it! all this took hell of follow-up e-mails, calls and so far no result.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 789,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Delhi,November 2023,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Before booking the flight, I called customer care and asked whether we would be availed with the bassinet or not and we were informed that the bassinet seats are given to the parents on a first come first serve basis. Once check-in was enabled we were assigned with default seats and they were not next to the bassinet so we called the customer care again to confirm. We were instructed by the customer care person to not change the default allocated seats and asked us to reach 4 hours before departure time to the airport as bassinet seats can only be assigned to parents at the airport while boarding. So we did as instructed and reached Paris airport before 4 hours departure but to our surprise all the bassinet seats were already sold out. As per ground staff there are 2 bassinets in economy out of which one bassinet is taken by a parent and other seat next to bassinet is assigned to a lady travelling alone. Ground staff assured us that they will make a request to the lady and ask her to swap the seat with one of us so we can have the bassinet for our daughter. When boarding was about to start (same ground staff present who said they will make the request) we reminded again to the staff but as per them the lady was still not there so we were again asked to go ahead and they will make a request once she will board the flight and we again trusted them. Now once we boarded the flight , the crew in flight said they can not request someone to give their seats to us and it's no longer possible to have the bassinet seat. The best thing we found in this entire scenario is that none of the bassinet seats were assigned to parents. All those seats were sold to individuals (we were lied by the ground staff saying that its given to a parent but all three person sitting were individuals and not even travelling together as a family) who paid for extra leg space so my question is why are those seats called bassinet seats at all and you even say it to parents that those seats are designed for parents travelling with kids and can be only given to the parents on first come first basis when this is not at all followed by your staff or your system anywhere? We requested multiple times from the customer care to let us choose those seats beforehand and we were even ready to pay for the charge also? Even after doing this much followup a simple thing can not be done by your staff then am not sure how you are operating this big airline. We would have happily travelled with our daughter without bassinet if those seats were given to other parents with higher needs but those seats were assigned to individuals with no kids while others were just struggling with their kids.",Vistara

Unfortunately, the initial flight from Bangalore experienced a half-hour delay, which caused concern as I had a tight connection in Delhi to catch my Vistara flight to Kathmandu. Upon arrival in Delhi, I immediately proceeded to the International transfer office to seek assistance. Regrettably, the Vistara staff informed me that I would not be able to catch my connecting flight. They mentioned they could provide an alternative, and I suggested two possible options: Royal Nepal Airlines A330 and Air India A319/20. However, the staff working there insisted that no alternatives were available and informed me that I had to stay in Delhi for a day. When I requested accommodation, the Vistara staff provided the name of a hotel called ""Saptagiri."" Concerned about the poor reviews of this hotel on Google Maps, I asked for a better alternative. I was directed to speak with a senior staff member who wore an Air India identity card. This individual was incredibly rude and unhelpful, insisting that I had no choice but to stay at the designated hotel. His behavior was both dominating and frustrating. Upon arriving at the suggested hotel, I found it to be in a deplorable condition, far worse than expected. To my shock, the hotel owner informed me that Vistara Airways had only allocated Rs. 400 per guest for food, which was wholly inadequate. I eventually managed to return via Vistara Air on the 17th, but this entire experience has left a lasting negative impression.

What happened to customer service? The flight was fine. The breakfast was inedible, except for the bread. For lunch there was a Thai dish offered but there was none left by the time the attendant got to me. I had some nonveg chicken dish. It was terrible. One hundred percent inedible. All in all I was completely dissatisfied with Vistara for this trip. A couple of important lessons I learned. First, there's no advantage in flying economy premium.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Mumbai to Delhi,June 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,5.0,3,yes,5,"  Vistara has for some time been the benchmark in Indian aviation with amazing service and attentive staff. Unfortunately due to personal issues, I was unable to fly for the last 4 months of so and was happy to be back in the air for a trip to Delhi on Vistara. I blocked the first row of economy class since the fare difference between economy and premium economy was quite high for the travel date. While the ground experience remains consistently good pre and post boarding. the in-air experience in economy has been quite degraded. For a morning 6 am flight, Vistara did not offer tea/coffee in economy class. The breakfast was very poor and my omelette was inedible. No condiments except a small roll and butter on offer.  Now coming to the Club Vistara program. I called up Vistara, 2 weeks prior to my flight, as I had 2 Upgrade vouchers and wanted to use one and asked them to recommend a flight on which I could use my upgrade voucher (any flight and ok with either Eco to Prem Eco or Prem Eco to Business) and I was told that no upgrades available even 2 weeks before flying. Imagine my surprise that i could see at least 2-3 empty seats in premium economy in the flight i was traveling in. ",Vistara
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Dhaka to London Heathrow via Delhi,June 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," It was an utterly awful experience from start to finish. I fly this route a lot, usually with Emirates or Qatar and had read some good things so thought I’d try out Vistara business class. The fun started at boarding in Dhaka where there was no business priority and an approx. hour queue to clear security in to the gate where three separate flights were taking off from. Dhaka is an old airport with security at the gates but other airlines manage it just fine. There was only one Vistara employee checking boarding cards and when I asked him about Business priority and told him I would miss the flight he just shrugged and walked off. I only made the flight by taking my life in my hands and queue jumping, nearly causing a riot in the process. The flight Dhaka to Delhi is Premium economy not business - the seat is even labelled as such. Transfer at Delhi very odd - despite having a boarding pass I was escorted to the transfer desk to be given another one. I couldn’t access the WiFi as I hadn’t been sent the code I apparently needed (and no one on board has any). And then having paid $20 for it; it cut off halfway through (despite being advertised as ‘whole flight’) and I had to pay again! And then to cap it off, on arrival at Heathrow the business class bags came off last rather than first, which felt like a good summation of the whole experience. Never again.",Vistara

After their confirmation regarding the extra baggage added in the PNR, they didn't allow me to board without charge of extra luggage. It was a hot discussion at the Ahmedabad airport and they treated me with totally rude behaviour and wasted 3 hours at the airport. They don't know the meaning of humbleness and the fact came out that there is not synchronization between their team. Customer team response totally disagreed by their airport team. Since last 35 days, I'm sending chasers to them but received 2 emails that to with incomplete information and denied to give the refund. Worst experience I have ever had in my life for this flight.

Due to delays on Vistara, the flight did not land in time to make the connecting flight to Udaipur - even though we were assured on the flight over to Delhi by the staff onboard that since the delay was about 40 min, the connecting flight would wait for the 20 passengers to Udaipur. At Delhi airport, the Vistara ground staff told us that the connecting flight had departed and that they were trying to figure out what to do. We were asked to reclaim our suitcases in Delhi and told that we would be booked on an Indigo flight that was due to leave in 3 hours time. No other information was provided for almost 2 hours, and we were repeatedly told when enquiring that the ""seniors officers"", who did not appear once in front of us were working on the issue. With less than 1 hour to go, we were handed printed paper tickets on 8x11 sheets with random passenger's barcodes on both side of the sheets of paper and told to make our way to Terminal 1. We now had to pair up with random passengers and travel together so that we could go through security at the other terminal. Nobody escorted. the group of 20 to Terminal 1, which is 20+ minutes by a shuttle bus that weaves through the city traffic to Terminal 1 from Terminal 3. We got to terminal 1 with 2 minutes before they closed baggage intake. As a premium economy passenger, the baggage allowance is 30 Kg on Vistara, and we were assured by the ground staff that the baggage allowance would be honored as Vistara had called ahead to Indigo. To our surprise, Indigo told us that no such calls were placed and that we had to pay for any excess baggage above the standard 15 Kgs. We had to shell out INR 8250 (over $100) for excess baggage just so that we could get on the flight. When I called Vistara to rectify the situation, I was placed on hold for 25 min and eventually the line was cut off. On the 2nd call, after a 15 minute conversation I was told that they could not do anything for me and that I have to return to the Vistara counter where the Indigo ticket was issued to argue my case in Delhi. When I asked to speak to a ""senior"", I was told that they would reach out to me in 1 to 2 hours. The calls never came. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service. My attempts to rectify the situation with Vistara was essentially ignored.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ahmedabad to Delhi,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,10,"  Very punctual on time flight even though we departed almost 15-20 minutes late due to previous flight from our gate departed very late. The boarding of more than 100 pax was completed in almost 20 minutes which is in my opinion very efficient. Inflight service was very good with good quality of food with both veg and non veg option which is included in the fare. Condition of the cabin, seat and overall aircraft was up to date. The inflight entertainment was also good. Overall a very pleasant experience flying with Vistara.",Vistara

Unless you have money to waste or want to be treated like a freeloader don't travel on Vistara. The staff both on ground and in flight treat the passengers like they are travelling for free. There is absolutely no respect given. On top of this the operations are terrible to say the least. The gates at Heathrow were announced 15 minutes before the gates closed. Considering the size of the airport it was highly inconvenient. The flights neither take of nor land in time. Our fight was supposed to depart from Delhi airport at 15:55 as per their boarding pass. But they called us to check our baggage for something at around 1545 even though the luggage was cleared at Heathrow airport and Delhi customs. They made us wait for absolutely no reason for almost half an hour. We had to run back to the boarding gate so that we don't miss our flight. For the price we pay the service is pathetic to say the least. The staff who are hardly exist around the airport are so arrogant and rude. I would rather walk for a day or 2 than fly in a one hour flight of Vistara.,Vistara
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Ahmedabad,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,1,yes,2," Delhi to Ahmedabad. I was flying back from US on Lufthansa and had connection of Vistara from Delhi to Ahmedabad. Everything seemed perfect, the staff was helping and aircraft was superb, but when my luggage arrived my two wheels of my Samsonite bag were damaged. One was damaged and the other one was totally missing, the staff at airport was so polite and offer me charges of Rs150. It was a joke. Everyone knows how much full size Samsonite bag costs. It was better if they denied to pay. I had a flight of 30 hrs and was so tired that I left the airport after giving a very good smile to airport staff. Didn’t expected this from TATA.",Vistara
Not Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,"London, UK to Pune, India via Delhi, India",June 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  I flew Vistara for the first time internationally. My experience right from conversations with customer service in London until my arrival in Poona suggests that there is a serious culture problem with the airline. I tried to check in online 5 times and called customer service for assistance. It was clear that the online check in needs more sophistication so I politely asked if they would take feedback to help improve it. The response was “no one has ever had such a problem”. The tone and response smacked of apathy and lack of professionalism. I have wide ranging experience with many airlines and customer service but haven’t experienced this as far as I can remember. On the plane, the stewardesses were robotic and cold, not to mention uninformed. The flight was late taking off from London. Thinking ahead about my connecting flight I asked if we could have the customs forms. These girls did not understand what I was asking and when I explained again they said there was no such form required. Arriving in Delhi, there was no ground staff to assist many of us who had connecting flights. To top it, many us who had priority and transfer tags in our bags waited 55 minutes for our bags. There was no ground staff to help. All of us missed our connecting flight due to the bags being egregiously delayed. I arrived in Pune in 24 hours. Vistara how can you compete in today’s customer centric world with such an apathetic attitude and deplorable service. I am dreading my flight back to London. Never again will I fly Vistara.",Vistara
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Delhi to Coichin,July 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Had a bad pre-flight experience with the airline, I had accidentally booked 15 kgs of extra Luggage instead of 10 KG. I contacted Vistara customer care to reduce my extra Luggage to 10 KG and refund the rest as airline points so as that I can use it in my return flight to Delhi after a month. I offered to make an additional 10kg purchase of luggage along with this carryover 5KG right away, but they refused to help me out. These requests were made 6 hrs prior to my first flight here from Auckland. ",Vistara
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,June 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I didn't expect anything else or special from Vistara. In fact I was a little apprehensive as I had never heard of them before, but I should not have. My experience was made good by the generosity and kindness of the crew. Nothing was too much of a trouble. Despite the fact that they work so hard to look after so many passengers the smiles and pleasantries never stopped. My row of economy class passengers from London to Delhi (UK0018) was looked after by Rajeev and Tanya. Such genuine, polite and hard working people. She was a lovely host and probably the best airline crew I came across in a long while. ""Thank you Rajeev and Tanya"" and rest of the team. Fly with Vistara, they are the best, a very human and pleasant experience. ",Vistara
