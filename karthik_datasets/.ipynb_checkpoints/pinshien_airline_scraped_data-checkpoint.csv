jarrod,"August 9, 2023",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Premium Economy Class,5.0,2,2,3,1,1,1,2,No,This airlines has no way to upgrade tickets at the local offices and/or online even for a fee and the gate agents at the airport are also unwilling or unable to do so even when empty seats exist Food was not up to standard on the flight
Daniel,"July 18, 2023",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,1,1,0,No,I was told that the plane was ”completely overbooked” and put on standby and asked if I wanted to take a much later flight and get 250 euro. Even though I booked my ticket 4 months before. Did all the people who got a seat book earlier than that??????????????? I had to wait in panic for the boarding until I got a seat. I was panicing about my luggage and my transfer at the destination. I was given no information at all. I could not check in online the day before. Dreadful experience and I will never fly with Aegean again. Nice way for me to start my vacation! This is no way to treat your paying customers!!!!!!! ?????????

Victor,"May 23, 2023",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Business Class,8.0,5,4,3,2,5,5,3,Yes,"Pretty good Airline. Perfectly digitalised checking, boarding etc. works better than with many big airlines"
Iria,"November 19, 2022",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,No,"My carry-on bag has been checked from Athens to Heathrow on 01th October/22 , when I went to pick it up it was very broken, I made a complaint at the airport counter and then at Aegean online and I didn’t get any response about it."
Santosh,"September 30, 2021",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,2,1,3,1,2,No,"I had a flight booked for BEG-ATH-DOH-AKL. On 14th Sep, Aegean airline issued me a boarding pass and I boarded the flight and upon reaching Athens they told me that I and my 09 year old son cannot board the next flight as our final flight of Qatar airways will be landing at Australia for a technical halt, and we did not have a transit Visa. I was neither aware of this nor it was mentioned in our ticket or boarding pass. Aegean airlines staff handed over us to Greece border police who kept us in detention centre which was a dirty and un hygienic place where refugees are held. No Aegian airline staff contact us after that and didn’t give us drinking water for 2 days. Greece border police deported us back to Belgrade. They never briefed us what is happening and gave us a refusal to entry letter which we never asked for. Denied us even wifi during the period of detention thus we could not contact our family.  The act by the staff towards an International traveler with a minor child was gross violation of passenger charter."
Christos,"August 17, 2020",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,4.0,3,4,2,3,1,1,0,No,"Unacceptable behaviour from the “lead” Greek Airlines. I will drop the luggage policy that was changed recently and was not clearly communicated (many people had to pay for laptop bags), and I will jump to covid measures. No distance in the queue, no good organisation on how you enter and go out of the plane and in general I saw people without masks (passengers but still). I chose Aegean and paid the difference to be safer, but I flew with Easyjet the same month and it was way better. Disappointing…"
Chandlor,"April 22, 2020",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I had a family booking with Aegean over Easter 2020. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the flights were cancelled. This is understandable. What is NOT understandable is that Aegean now refuses to give refunds. This goes against EU commission rules 261/2004. Aegean does not care and completely refused to refund my booking of almost 450 Euro. I feel like I’ve been stolen from. They have offered a voucher, but since 2 of the party where coming from the United States, the whole trip has been cancelled. The credit voucher is useless for them. This is blatantly against the law to not give a refund for a cancelled flight."
Jadson,"February 27, 2020",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,3,3,3,,4,4,No,"having any issue with your luggage ?! God save you, they’ll not even help you with your rights."
John,"January 7, 2020",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Business Class,10.0,4,4,4,1,5,5,5,Yes,"Aegean Airlines is by far the best European regional airline. Other big players like Deutsche Lufthansa, KLM or British Airways fall seriously behind in terms of service, commodity and particularly food! High quality seats, fast traveling times, very attentive cabin attendants that try to accommodate every crazy passenger need and superb food put this airline in the forefront of Europe. On the constructive side, the entertainment is poor, there is no wifi connectivity in most flights, and intra-European flights are slightly expensive compared to other airlines."
Stavros,"November 29, 2019",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"One of the best airlines in Europe. Having traveled with most European airlines due to my occupation, Aegean simply delivers better services. Unlike established airlines that pretend not to be budget but are on the cheap side (for example check Lufthansa. The seats are similar to sitting on wood. Or a Lotus Elise.. not comfortable at all) or Budget airlines that feel like taking the bus somewhere in rural India, Aegean offers the average person, safety, comfort, food, and overall a pleasant, hassle free trip."
Marija,"March 19, 2019",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,"I have already read here, that someone had a similar problem. I wanted to change one letter in the name of the passenger (as my native language has some letters that do not exist in the English alphabet, and I was not provided the appropriate guide for these matters) and they wanted to charge an additional 90 euros for the ticket that cost 215 euros in the first place. I find this to be outrageous. For example, I had the same issue for the same trip only different destination with WIzzair, and I could do this change by myself online FOR FREE. I am not satisfied at all."
Ioannis,"October 1, 2018",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,4,2,0,,,1,No,"If you have any mobility issue just stay AWAY from this company. Really. They don’t allow you to wait sitted before you enter the plane if you pass the boarding, but there is no priority if you don’t have assistance in the ticket so you even if you are the last passenger to proceed at the gate you ll end up standing for a very long time until you arrive to your seat. Then they might ask you to climb the seats to sit next to a window for “your safety” after asking you out loud questions like what your problemis exactly and why you need a crutch, if you are injured or you have general problems etc. Most airlines allow you to keep medical items such as crutches somewhere close to you and if not, someone will give them to you quite early. In Aegean you take them back only if some passenger is kind enough to give them back to you and they will be scratched. If you are late to exit the plane, you might hear some comments about you. You might also hear the crew girls discuss their personal lifes from time to time during the trip. Finally, you might see some weird practices for example the low salt meal is served with salted crackers (2.3g of salt per 100g) so if you are supposed to avoid salt for medical reasons please make sure you have checked the ingredients…"
Dorothea,"May 8, 2018",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"On the 12th of February I flew with Aegean Airlines from Tel Aviv to Munich. My checked in luggage was lost on the flight. Immediately after arrival in Munich, I notified the airline of my loss. I contacted the airline via Email and phone asking for help. However, I received little response from the customer service department. They said they were looking for my suitcase, but I am not sure whether they ever did. 45 days after my arrival I claimed compensation under the Montreal Convention. Now Aegean Airlines refuses to grant me such, stating, that I never checked in my suitcase, because I cannot provide them with a suitcase tag number. The fact that I didn’t receive a tag isn’t my own fault, but a mistake of the airline. After the dozens of Emails and giving a detailed description of my suitcase and of the items in it greatest disappointed is, that I am now treated as a fraud by the Aegean, who are trying to make it look like I am trying to claim false compensation. I cannot believe that Aegean, an airline I thought highly of, ignores its passenger’s rights."
Barbara,"September 21, 2017",Aegean Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,4,5,0,,,5,Yes,"We had a problem with our flight at the beginning of our five week trip throughout Europe. As soon as we arrived home, I submitted a claim resulting from the problem. Aegean answered that they were under no obligation to resolve our problem because we did not submit our claim within the stipulated 21 days. While we submitted the claim within two days of getting home, it was well over the 21 days – we did not have the means to submit the claim while out of the country. Very disappointed that Aegean did not look at the big picture when sending this “canned” response!"
Foch,"October 15, 2022",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,1,,3,1,No,"Where do I even start the rant from? The leg space in standard seats were designed for dwarfs I think. Staff is very unfriendly. Can’t count how many times I was woken up by staff and their trolleys hitting random body parts while sleeping (and it’s extremely hard for me to fall asleep on plane). They’re not there to ensure your comfort. They’re rude and feels like they do you a favour every time you ask for something. The food is a joke, my 12 year old can cook a better dinner, disgusting, gives you terrible gas. Do not choose this airline, there are much better ones, with free wi fi too. Thank you NOT aer lingus"
Nathan,"September 8, 2022",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"I missed my flight from AMS Amsterdam to DUB Dublin because I could not get my boarding pass unless I stood in line at the Check-in/Ticket Counter. The real problems were the Kiosks available for passengers who can print their own boarding passes did not have the Aer Lingus app and there was only ONE PERSON at the Check-in/Ticket Counter, with a line of passengers that was very long, and I had arrived nearly 3 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart. I missed my flight, came back to the Check-in/Ticket Counter and there was no one there. Aer Lingus basically made me miss my flight then abandoned me at an airport in a foreign country. Two AMS representatives got me over to SwissPort which is affiliated with Aer Lingus. SwissPort got me on another flight to get home to LAX Los Angeles. I was on my feet for 8 hours during this whole ordeal and got home very late. I found out later that Aer Lingus has a reputation for passengers missing flights, small staff of employees at many locations, and NOT GIVING A DAMN about their passengers. I strongly advise: Stay away from Aer Lingus!"

Anjy,"June 21, 2022",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,No,"I flew two weeks ago, and my bag never arrived. This has never happened to me with any other airline, and I have travelled with many from BA and Emirates to Ryanair (another Irish airline)."
Matthew,"July 8, 2021",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"They offered a steal of a deal during the pandemic. I knew I was gambling on most of the ticket fee, since it wasn’t refundable, and I ended up having to cancel because hotels weren’t open in Dublin at the time. They still owed me the $80 refund of the government fee."
Viktoria,"August 27, 2019",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Although there was a huge queue for the passport control at Amsterdam Airport and had to spend 45 minutes in security lines, I managed to get to the gate 15 minutes before departure time, but the assistant didn’t let me on board, as the door was already closed even though people were stuck at airport control. They ruined my birthday weekend with my family. Totally inhuman treatment and they refuse to give any refund, the customer service is not available during weekends and during weekdays after 20 minutes waiting time they hang up if they receive a complaint. WORST company ever!!!"
CHANTAL,"June 27, 2019",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,No,Aer lingus you are the worst air line I have ever dealt with and should be embarrassed of your customer service.Not only is your airport lounge pathetic but you guys lost my luggage and nobody appears to take accountability. I been missing my luggage for the past 10 days called several times(DUBEI54186). Wasting money and time. Just to be lied to and been accused of lying which makes me extremely angry. Was promised that my luggage would be delivered on Saturday(22.06). Was promised three supervisor call backs and nobody feels responsible. also the airport lounge is terrible. Don´t go there. Waste of money!!
Michele,"April 7, 2019",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,,5,5,Yes,"Extraordinary! I was one of the thousands that had been stranded by WOW airlines abroad. A lot of articles suggested Icelandair, they had you open a case, send all your personal information to prove you had paid already & told you to call to get a discounted rate as a rescue fair (the fair provided to me would have caused me to miss my flight within the states back home and been more than I could purchase for a normal flight on the open market through other carriers). I called Aer Lingus (https://www.aerlingus.com/html/home.html) and asked if they were giving discounted rates, they were sympathetic, got me on a flight I needed not to miss my instate flight back home and gave me a discount with out jumping through hoops. They really were there for the stranded Americans abroad. And, I flew on 4 different carriers during my travel trip abroad and they were absolutely the BEST! I had a very comfortable almost 8hour flight from Dublin Airport to Newark International Airport. I highly recommend this carrier! Go Aer Lingus!"
Breandan,"March 9, 2019",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,2,3,1,2,No,"Booked return flights from Dublin (DUB) to Denver, via Chicago (ORD) with Aer Lingus. Flew Aer Lingus Dublin-Chicago and partner airline (UA) for internal US flights. On arrival in ORD, T5, had to transfer to T1  (monorail out of service, bus transfer only) but on arrival in T1 was informed that my connecting flight had been cancelled – no warning, no email, no text, nothing! Very friendly UA staff had no other flight to offer but arranged alternative  AA flight for me much later that evening, but now had to go to T3!! Turns out, our bags got to Denver 3 or 4 hours before we did – how did that happen?!?!! When returning home, the ORD to DUB flight was delayed 4 hours, again, no contact from Aer Lingus, no explanation. I wrote to Aer Lingus (both email and post) 7 times – not as much as an acknowledgement, no explanation, no apology and absolutely no compensation! Dreadful service."
David,"September 10, 2018",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,4,3,0,,,0,No,"The check in and flight itself was good. On time and reasonable. I am a cyclist and scientist and traveling for conference and training. I booked and paid for a bicycle. However, on return my bicycle carry box was damaged externally. I have had no offer of acceptance/not of liability, letter etc. When home (Glasgow), the bike frame had be damaged, which would have required a heavy force e.g. dropped form back of plane, heavy baggage dumped on top etc. The frame was unridable and needed replacing. I fly about 40 flights a year and have done for over 5 years with bike in this format with zero issues (mainly Air New Zealand and other Star Alliance carriers). OK. so occasionally some handling error may occur, this is life. However, I called, wrote, filled out online forms as recommended by AerLIngus. Replies were short and noted “please wait out team is reviewing it”. I followed up 9 times over 2 months and still no response. I have now moved to my travel insurer for recovery of damage costs. Aer Lingus’ baggage-ralated customer services is appalling 0.5 out of 10. It left a very sour taste and I would not travel Aer Lingus again nor can recommend this airline. If you do value your baggage and must travel with this poor airline, ensure you have it fully insured. reading other comments here, the airline has a baggage handling issue to sort out. Cheers."
Emily,"June 1, 2018",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,,,2,No,"This was my first time flying with Aer Lingus. I have flown on many airlines all over the world and this flight was one of the worst flights have ever experienced. On both legs of the flight the staff were rude, and on my first leg of the flight the plane itself was obviously not well maintained. It was dirty, my seat did not recline, and weirdest of all there was a gaping hole in between my seat and the window – which dropped down into the pit of the plane. If you make the mistake of falling asleep and your phone dropping from your lap to the floor as I did, you can lose your phone into the gaping hole in the airplane. I tried calling their customer service to explain the situation and they all spoke to me like I was an idiot and just repeated that they were not responsible for my lost property, then finally directed me toward an online lost item submission form…which yielded the same answer. I recommend avoiding this airline at all costs."
Navya,"May 31, 2018",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,2,2,,,2,No,"I fly 3+ times a year internationally and this was my first time flying Aer Lingus. The transatlantic flight from Seattle to Dublin was delayed, awfully dirty and the seats wouldn’t recline. The staff was impolite. The domestic flight from Dublin to Birmingham was worse; the management was a mess. As I was getting through security, the airline updated the monitors that the flight had left, whereas they hadn’t even started boarding. Thee were always unaccessible whenever I reached out. This flight was cheap and the food (on the transatlantic carrier only) was good but the pros are not worth the hassle. I would recommend finding a better airline. Their organization is a mess and they are unreliable. You get what you pay for. If you do decide to fly through them, get travel insurance and cover your bases. Good luck!"
Kathy,"January 25, 2018",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,1,1,3,,,2,No,"Don’t fly with them if you can avoid it. Horrible experience with Aer Lingus. I have flown with them 4x and the first 3 were great. I noticed a decline in their service and appearance of the plane. The plane was dirty and old, and the attendants were snooty and could hardly bother themselves to help you. My trip that I was planning for 6 mos with my daughters was cut short by a day because my flight was cancelled due to mechanical errors. We were able to get on a flight for the next day, but I lost $400 on hotel rooms for the night we lost. And they will do nothing about it. They rejected my claims. So you will be taking a chance on anything pre-paid and your flight does not take off when it was scheduled"
Paddy,"January 19, 2018",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,4,Yes,"Flight from Dublin to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Dec 2017. Excellent staff, my wife suffers from tinnitus , staff moved us to area of low engine noise. Constant attention and care through out the flight. Will fly Aer Lingus again."
Joseph,"December 1, 2017",Aer Lingus,4.6,Flew Economy Class,8.0,2,2,1,3,,,2,No,"My wife and I had paid in advance for window seats to and from Dublin. Upon leaving to come back to the US, we were seated in the middle. Crying kids in front of us and beside us. I had picked up toys being tossed by kids, bottles rolling on the floor.. We had no sleep on our return to the US. The stewardess were not at all helpful in making even an attempt to reseat my wife and I. I’ve contacted Customer Care of Aer LIngus several times with only a message saying that we will contact you shortly! Well, shortly has been nearly two months later. It was a Great flight and loved Ireland.. We did not get what we had paid for…. No help from the stewardess and even making an attempt to reseat us/or even compensate us.. The Customer Care doesn’t even care about our issue’s. I’ve requested their corporate address/email..phone number..but as usual no one has made any contact! I DOUBT that I would ever choose this air line to travel back to Ireland… Very DISAPPOINTED with you Aer Lingus. Lets see how long it takes now to hear from someone…."

Had to wait an extra 4 hours for another plane to bring our bags which is not only inconvenient but also a security risk. Horrible airline.

Seats ok for the short haul flight of 1 1/4 hour. Service was ok but as extensive as you would expect on such a short flight. Ground services are what really let this down, the Terminal in Lagos & PHC are quite poor then the walking across tarmac to mobile steps that are not the best, in all weather."
Aero,"March 4, 2023",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,Yes,"On 21.01.23 there were two departures from Bangkok by Aeroflot, at 11:30 and 13:35. Aeroflot didn’t get the right number of passengers for 2 flights, and they decided to save money. The way I see it, in that situation they should have warned the passengers at least 24 hours before departure that everyone was flying at 1:35 pm and departed at 1:35 pm. What actually happened? Better fly in Aviator with a chance to win money https://aviatorplaygame.com/"
James,"November 2, 2022",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,10.0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,Yes,I was on this airline a month ago. A perfect airlines to travel. Highly recommended.

Non c’è lo schermo per l’intrattenimento ma in complesso lo consiglio. Sulla tratta Mosca-Phuket invece c’è pochissimo spazio per le gambe l’intrattenimento è  sufficiente e il cibo passabile.

mariya,"January 4, 2020",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"When my dad passed away, he wanted to be buried in his home city – Saint-Petersburg. After a consultation with Aeroflot and Russian Embassy, we understood that in order to travel with funeral urn, we need to collect, translate and legalize few documents. When  I arrived at Sheremetyevo airport on 11.12.2019,I asked once again the representatives of Aeroflot, if I can travel further and is everything all right. They told me that all the documents are correct. On 12.12.2019  I arrived in Vnukovo airport. At the registration desk, the representative of Aeroflot/Russian airlines told me, that I am not allowed to travel with the urn and that is company policy. I told her, that I collected all the required documents and that I traveled from Sofia to Moscow with Aeroflot and with funeral urn in my luggage.They didn’t know the company policy at all. After a 10 minute call, they told me, that I can transport the urn with cargo but not on the plane, but if I do so, I will miss the plane, so the best  I can do is to buy a ticket for their next flight."

Victoria,"August 30, 2019",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I have never traveled with such an unprofessional airline. Did not reach the other flight. A lot of other passengers had the same problem and there was a very long queue where you had to stand for about 100 minutes before getting help since they had only staffed two people. The staff cant communticate in English. It seems that all those employed by this airline hate their lives, they are on their cell phones rather than coming up with menus when you sit down at the restaurants, they do not smile at all and show that they are not interested in providing good customer care. We have never experienced vare the like ever. We have met at least 30 people who say they will never travel with this airline again. HR has failed miserably on which staff are employed in the company, and it is clear that it is control-based / financial-based HR, rather than a commitment-based HR."
Fabienne,"July 20, 2019",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Premium Economy Class,2.0,1,2,1,2,1,3,2,No,First flight was a connecting flight from zurich to moscow sheremetievo and then to tolyo narita.our flight started more than 1 hour later without explanation in english. We missed the second föight and waited for them to find a solution for at least an hour. Then we had to run through the airport in 7 minutes to catch a flight to peking. In peking no one could speak english or did understand what our problem was. We had to change glight and had to stop additionally in shanghai. Everxtime with check in and security. No one told us about the second stop. At last in tokyo our luggage was missing. On our flight back they lost our luggage again. Never again.
Musicland,"July 7, 2019",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Yes,"Aeroflot deceived its customers! 1. Flight SU 291 Hanoi – Moscow Sheremetyevo (HAN-SVO) at 10:45 on 06 Apr 2019 was delayed until  14:16,. This resulted in the cancellation of my second Moscow – Paris CDG flight (A ticketed by Aeroflot SU2460 – departure at 19:35 the same day April 6) and led to my cancellation of Paris CDG. 2. Through the SU291, I have arrived to Moscow Sheremetyevo about 20:00 Moscow time (6 April). After an hour of waiting in line (there were a lot of cases of passengers like me, about 150 passengers), the officer Aeroflot told me that I needed to wait until 22:00 to meet another staff who will give me the hotel voucher to sleep overnight. – 22:00 Aeroflot: come back here at 23:00, we will answer! – 23:00:Aeroflot: we are waiting confirm-invitation from Hotel! Wait until 24:00! – 24:00: Aeroflot did not receive any invitation from Hotel, we have not any  more information!"
Michael,"June 26, 2019",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"My wife and son flew Aeroflot with a connection through Sheremyetova, Aeroflot’s central hub. The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes on the plane for the terminal bus, and then for all passengers to disembark. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, “they will give you seats on the next flight.” By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their flight to JFK had already closed. Aeroflot desk agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700! Many other people were in the same situation. A little old Russian lady tells an agent, “I can’t pay, I don’t have any money, I spent all my pension on the first ticket.” The Aeroflot agent responds, “Don’t you have any relatives you can call that could pay for your ticket?”"

Lusine,"April 21, 2019",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,4,1,3,1,1,2,No,"This review is specifically about a check in employee of Aeroflot. My parents (both in their 70’s) and I had shopped in the airport and had a few bags in hand. Understandably, we were asked to consolidate the bags so that each of us had 2 bags. We obliged, meeting both weight requirements and having our bags fit inside the sample box of the acceptable hand bag items. She seemed to have a personal vengeance making us go back and forth twice to the weighing table even though another employee had already done so. She even brought out a measuring tape. Each item was under 5 pounds. I had a plastic bag with clothing and she made me further consolidate because the height was a millimeter above the height requirement. She was so incredibly harsh with our bags that she ripped the handles off of a recyclable bag I had in addition to ripping in its entirety a plastic bag I had with items purchased in the airport. Another male employee was supporting me and even taking photos to share back with management.  I will never fly this airline ever again."
MICHELLE,"January 16, 2019",Aeroflot,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"My daughter flew with Aeroflot and due to horrendous queues at passport check and security, a connecting flight was missed along with 100’s of other people. She alerted airport staff at security check and was told to push to the front. Other passengers pushed her back shouting that they too were about to miss their flights. WIFI is almost impossible to use at Moscow, so without communications she was understandably very upset to have missed her flight. The staff at the airport were extremely rude and unhelpful telling her it was her fault that she missed the connection, however with hundreds of other people all missing connecting flights it would appear not. She had to queue for another hour just to talk to customer service…… With no other options, we had to book her another ticket at considerable expense and then told that her return flight was invalid, due to her missing the connecting flight. So yet another expense booking her flight home. One of the busiest times of the year, you can imagine how much money we have spent on these flights. Response from customer service took exactly 1 month. A long winded message to say, she checked in at Heathrow accepting the transit time and ticket conditions, so there is nothing they will do. I have posted on local facebook pages asking if anyone has had the same issue. It’s remarkable how many people have faced the exact same problem and even more who have lost or had their baggage damaged. I even had people respond who had been on other flights transiting at the same time and told me of the chaos. My advise is to avoid this airline at all cost!"

In case of luggage, If you lost /delay/damaged luggage then after that services are very poor, staff is very rude and non-cooperative.

I have traveled in and around central and South America for over 8 years. I have experienced the worst and the best of flying in this part of the world. I live in Kingston jamaica. We arrived three hours early for our first flight as advised, only to wait three hours until any information appeared. No one in Kingston really knew of the flight. It was only by chance we met with two people who we knew were taking the same flight and had to make decisions together. In Cuba however there is not just one terminal, there are 5. No one really knew which terminal we had to go to. An hour of different people telling us to go to different terminals, led us to find again by chance the flight written on the electronic board, something which never happened in Kingston. It is like catching a bus with  no timetable, no idea of when or where it was departing and all around you people telling you different things or fellow flyers with similar experiences. What a nightmare. Finally managed to board only for the man who initially told us that this was the wrong terminal to be the one who was checking us in. What a j"

All the other flights have always arrived on time or earlier, had a friendly crew and they have never lost my luggage. I know there have been some bigger issues around, but that may also happen with other carriers. The Airline provides a reliable service with a basic inflight service including snacks and non-alcoholic drinks (comparable to its competitor’s) in domestic and regional flights in SouthAm. AR has one of the best safety records in the airline industry."

But a far better option than a night on hotell. I whrighted aeromar a small complain mail about what could be better in theyr service. And i got a mail back next day, where they  apolpgied about everything. And they wanted to give me a two way roundtrip ticet to any of theyr destinations for free.

It is one of the bad airlines to travel, they do not respect reservations and they do not solve anything for you."

It is now March and I still have not received my luggage or any compensation. I was originally offered $250 USD in compensation for the delay. I sent payment information and received nothing. They also informed me that if my bag was lost, then the $250 USD for the delay would be deducted from the total price of my luggage. After 21 days passed, I reached out again asking for compensation. After listing the contents of my bag, I was offered just over $500 USD. It cost me nearly $80 to check the bag and since the bag was lost, I was no longer eligible for the $250 for the delay. Basically, Aeromexico was telling me that the bag itself, the contents inside, all of the clothing and toiletries I had to pay for during my stay and the inconvenience of it all was worth about $170 USD. I have reached out via email, WhatsApp and phone several times. I’m extremely disappointed with this airline and their inability to resolve issues."

My flight was scheduled to take off at 8:55pm and at 9:10pm they announced that the flight was delayed for an hour because they were waiting for the flight crew. An hour later they said that they were still waiting for 2 crew members, they boarded another flight before our flight and no information about our flight, going on 2 hours Daley waiting for the other flight to board and not even the decency to informed us or give us an update. If any passenger is not at the airport at least 2 hours before the flight they will lose their flight and have to purchase a whole new ticket so I think that is only fair that the airline should have to reimburse all the passengers for the flight. I will be posting this on all platforms to make sure it’s heard and hope Aeromexico does something about it."

The first flight was chaotic with no pre-boarding or even standard zone loading. Fortunately, several gentlemen DID WHAT THE AIRLINE DID NOT and waved my amputee husband and me to the front of the line. On the second flight, there were no zones or even pre-boarding. 20-30 passengers were placed at the front, ignoring those who actually needed pre-boarding and those who were paying Premier, both of which we were. When seated, we watched as several economy passengers jammed their crap in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby’s carry-on-the one that held his medications — was scuffed and badly jammed."

Two months before our fight, Aeromexico changed the itinerary from Austin to Houston to Atlanta to Mexico City to Lima!  AND changed all from first class to coach except the leg from Mexico City to LIma.  This would have us changing planes four times and added 7 hours to our travel.  I tried for those two months to contact someone – anyone at Aeromexico who could address these unacceptable changes and was completely unsuccessful!!!  Aeromexico doesn’t have bad customer service, they have NONE. This itinerary was completely impossible for my elderly husband, so ultimately we just lost the trip and the money we spent. I continue to attempt to speak to a rep who can address this to no avail."

Aeromexico is stealing from customers by refusing to process “fully refundable” tickets. I paid A LOT extra for refundable and now 5 weeks later still don’t have my $1600 back! I have asked three times to speak with a supervisor and they refuse. Then I asked to speak with someone in the refund department and they told me that department doesn’t have a phone! HOW CONVENIENT.

I have traveled to hundreds of cities, and I have never experienced such a terrible level of service. I purchased a ticket, confirmed my flight and I was bumped from the flight at the last minute because they “didn’t have enough seats”. Of course, one would expect a refund, but even this was not confirmed at the gate and the airline said I need to reach out by phone. Here’s the catch – AeroMexico has no customer support phone line!!! They only accept emails. This is incredibly frustrating and borderline manipulative. Do not fly AeroMexico!"

I requested a refund three times from Chase.  Chase told me that 1) due to the pandemic, Aeromexico inhibited Chase’s ability to issue direct refunds to passengers, and 2) Aeromexico’s policy is to only offer travel credit even for flights that they cancel.  Three and a half months after the cancellation, I still don’t have my refund."

Unfortunately, I once again learned that they do not care about their customers.  Owing to a mechanical issue, my Delta (DL) flight from SLC arrived over an hour late into MEX  leaving me about 50 minutes to make my connection on AeroMexico (AM) to OAX.  I moved as fast as humanly possible through immigration, customs, and another security screening to reach my gate 15 minutes to spare… or so thought.  The inconsiderate AM captain decided to shut the door 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure. The rude gate agents refused to ask him to reconsider on my behalf.  As it was the last flight of the day, I was rescheduled for the next day.  (Obviously, if I wanted to arrive the next day, I would have booked it that way.)  An elite status DL customer having traveled well over a million miles on over 80 airlines (literally around the world), I unfortunately must warn my fellow travelers that AeroMexico’s treatment and concern for their customers is as bad as it gets."

They refused to refund the money that i pay, that it was a round trip from Chile to Canada, (not cheap), even if they cancelled the flight. Is not the pandemic, some planes are flying anyway, and airports are open for the people that need it and have all the requirements to do so. The only option that they give me was an open ticket with them. That means, just 1 ticket. that also i have to pay the difference in money and also a expensive fee for service?.. this is a robbery."

The TL;DR version is Aeromexico promised a refund, over the course of 6 months denied the possibility that there was a mistake in the transaction, blamed us, blamed our bank, etc. after following up with several avenues (their phone number, their email, BBB) and being denied and dismissed, I finally found a local number and convinced a service rep to audit the transaction and was FINALLY given the refund.

The ground staff just left us in the dirty and gross lounge. 6 hrs later. We finally board. Unfortunately the lazy pilots did not pull up to the jet bridge. This meant that we had to walk across the huge runway. When we finally got in the ooooold Airbus a330-200(shudder) I first  noticed the tiny televisions the bad legroom and the very huge and comfortable green leather seats. The food was unidentifiable and the staff chewed gum and obviously didn’t mind cussing. Fizzy drinks were served that were best left alone all in all from me they get about a 7.

Air Algerie is like a family only relatives of workers get hired to work there no matter what type of work we’re talking about. Pilots run in the family for generation grandpa, father, son, ans daughters (not because the value women now instead first female pilot was hired only because her pilot daddy didn’t have a son to place there). Flight attendants are mostly not customer service-oriented, and flights are late all the time especially when keaving from airports outside Algeria: the reason? Crew and airport attendants spend quality time touring the nice european cities and Montreal in Canada. With the exception once and inly once where there was a tunisian national  among the flight attendant’s crew and he was extremely polite and a pleasure to fly with, the attendants to the least rude. Luggage delays at the airport itself, at keast in Algeria, is not due to air algerie but to other airport authorities scanning all luggages upon arrival behind the scenes and in multiple cases stealing valuables from travellers."
Mohammed,"March 23, 2014",Air Algerie,4.4,Flew Economy,0.0,1,1,1,1,,,3,No,"I would like to rate Air Algerie as a very poor airline service in all aspects. buying a ticket is always tricky, cheap tickets are are always sold to whom they know, when ever you contact Air Algerie over the phone  no one answers the phone  and if you got lucky and they do answer the phone they are always rude it has never been serious. and if you do buy a tick they make you pay for it in cash for them to avoid paying taxes.  checking in at the airport is nightmare, if you know someone that works there you can exceed the max weight no problem, if not they make you pay. departure of the flight never on time and your luggage could be lost. once in Algeria the waiting time for luggage collection is always the worst as you can wait for your bags more then 2 hours as they have to check every bag."

Baris,"September 4, 2018",Air Arabia,3.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,0,No,"Personnel Very Rude. Call Centre Misinforms. I chose Air Arabia over Pegasus because they promoted that they were providing more baggage allowance. When I called the call centre they said, I could purchase extra 20 kgs for 20 AED. And I canceled my Pegasus flight, then booked a flight from Air Arabia. When I went for check-in (at the sales branch at Al Ghurair Centre) the employee there (Mohamed) said I have 8 kgs excess baggage and I should pay 366 AED. I was shocked. I told him what I talked with the call center guy. But he insisted on the payment. Then I asked for a discount at least. He said “ok let’s consider it as 7 kgs and your payment is 310 AED). I said “This is not fair, you can be flexible about it. Other airlines are so. And also I was misinformed by your call center”. And he invited his manager. The manager (Anna) was very rude and grumpy. She grumbled “You have 8 kgs excess and you have to pay”. I said “What? A couple of minutes ago your personnel made a discount and now you’re even ignoring that?” She said “I’m his manager and it doesn’t matter what he says. It’s my word which is valid”. I gave up and said “ok, I will pay. I gave them my debit card” and she grumbled with a very rude face and tone of voice “We don’t accept card, pay in cash”. And I paid in cash. 1.) Air Arabia call centre does misinform 2.) The personnel at the check-in are rude. Thank you Air Arabia, you showed me all the reasons why I shouldn’t fly with you."
Rasha,"December 31, 2016",Air Arabia,3.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,2,2,,,3,No,"The worst experience of my life. I booked for the same day trip, and in an hour after booking i received an sms stating that the flight was rescheduled for the next morning. Ofcourse no one replied from the customer service to explain what that was about. The next day, we arrived into a chaiotic airport, people sleeping on the ground, and literally no place to squeeze in to go to the gate. As we finally made it, we waited by the gate side (standing up as all seats were taken) for 6 hours and still no one bothered to update us on the flight status. Every time we asked, we were faced with the same answer (you need to wait). No one bothered to provide water or juice to the passengers who had been waiting for long hours (some were waiting overnight). Wouldn’t recommend it to my enemy!!!"

Strange because when we boarded in Amsterdam they offered us that the handluggage could go with the normal luggage So in the plane, above the seats, the space of the handluggage was very empty !! When we arrived in Tanger there was no explanation,not at all !!! I waited for 3 days before our luggage arrived and we had to call many times before someone picked the phone !!!! We had a very hard 3 first days on our holiday because we had no clothes and medicine for my wife and our kid of 1,5 years old."

Hedan,"February 5, 2019",Air Astana,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I chose AirAstana to fly to Georgia. Yet when I tried to attain my boarding pass, I was told my Oman e-visa cannot be used as only visa, not e-visa, is acceptable. So the flight service officer took my passport and went through all my visa to see if any visa is acceptable as equivalent to enter Georgia. I have an Israel visa which is valid until 2025 for multiple entries. But this flight service officer is so unprofessional and did not tell me that one could work. I said I used all my visas as I did not know multiple entry Israel visa can still be acceptable to enter Georgia even though it was used once. And the service officer did not tell me that either. It is his job to know this knowledge and he did not. So I have to leave the airport. After I was on taxi on high way, I searched online and found out that multiple visa for Israel still can be used for Georgia entrance. So I exited high way and turn around and it is already passed 3:10. This particular service officer is so unprofessional and ruined my holiday. And his solution is to ask me to buy another ticket on my own!"
Kristina,"September 10, 2018",Air Astana,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,1,1,0,,,1,No,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND TERRIBLE SERVICE !!! Its overpriced flights, for a direct 6H flight from Hong Kong to Almaty i paid 1700USD! For this price during the flight we didnt have TV, worked only 1 toilet, can you imagine the toilet condition, it was disgusting! Food was terrible and stewardess completely ignored when i asked for water at list 5 times. It wasn’t the end, my nightmare starts on the flight back. I was flying back from Almaty to Hong Kong with stop at Beijing. I have Nomad Club and fly with AirAstatana more than 11 years, as I’m from Almaty Kazakhstan (KZ) but live in Hong Kong (HK) and no other airlines fly to KZ, means I dont have another choice if I need to see my family. When I was doing check-in at Almaty airport at AirAstana counter, as i have Nomad Club and its automatically set request window seat when i buy an online ticket, a representative from AirAstana said, they don’t know why it doesn’t work and they don’t have time to check what is the problem. They gave me only one boarding pass, however, did check in to my baggage directly to HK. AirAstana representative said i don’t need a Cina visa as only 2H transit and boarding pass they will give me at Beijing transit, as it was 5 AM flight transit counter WAS CLOSED! i couldn’t go through immigration as I don’t have Chinese visa… I almost missed my flight, luckily because i been crying for 2H at immigration desk, the lady at immigration helped me and wrote on a piece of paper my boarding pass, to let me go through immigration so i can go to different Terminal where was my flight to HK. That’s not the end, i arrived to HK my baggage was lost! I emailed and called to Airsatana the same date when I arrived in HK, they promised to find my baggage as soon as possible and study my case with their terrible service, its been one week since AirAstanas baggage department finally contacted me, ONE WEEK! Plus my suitcases arrived broken! And forgot to mention on my flight back, the same story no TV, food terrible, luckily toilet worked this time. I’m from Kazakhstan and I always recommended AirAstana to all my friend, colleagues and people which ask about the AirAstana."
Guat Ling,"December 27, 2017",Air Astana,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,3,,,3,No,"Recently,i joined a tour to Turkey on 1Dec till 10 Dec 2017. We transit at Almaty. When arrived Istanbul, one of our tour member and I didn’t get our baggage.We fi a report and was told by the person in charge at Celebi Ground Handling / Baggage Services that we will get our baggage back when we check in to hotel later. However, we only receive our baggage at the end of our tour which was on the 8th December although the baggage was found beforehand. I was upset with the inefficiency and irresponsible of Air Astana. This had brought a lot of inconveniences to me. I was forced to borrow a lot of needs from other tour member such as facial care products, international charger, lotion, lip balm, bio oil and so on. Besides that, I was also forced to repeat wearing my clothes again and again. This was such a mental torture to me. We were told that we might be able to claim but unsure the amount. The information given was very ambiguous and we dare not buy clothes and other necessities. Furthermore, my facial items cost me more than RM1000 in total. How should I buy when I wasn’t assured that I can claim? I only bought clothes at Kipa, a local shopping centre which was located at walking distance from our hotel on 6th December 2017, when I still didn’t receive my baggage. I was really puzzled and disappointed with the Air Astana and would like to request for compensation on this. I sent a few complaint to Air Astana but didnt receive reply from Air Astana for my last email dated 11 Dec 2017.

I was pleasantly surprised with the food and beverage, cabin interior (the 767 from KUL to ALA was refurbished to look like a 787) and in-flight entertainment. The only disappointments were a late departure in KUL and having to use a bus to board the ALA-TAS flight, despite there being only 3 international flights on the departures board."

Officers wanted to see the official medical documentation for pregnancy which had to prove my wife could fly on the date indicated in her ticket and confirming the pregnancy period. We showed the approval document from hospital exactly showing what they asked for. But Air Astana asked for another document in addition. We showed the Air Astana English website that our document had what website wanted us to prove, then they had internal phone calls which took more than 30 minutes, we waited all this time. Finally they didn’t let us to board. We lost our ticket although we presented the necessary information and we showed up on time. We explained that we followed the instructions obviously written Air Astana website in English to two duty officers and many other officers, but they couldn’t explain what they had to see in the other additional document they asked for. My wife flied with Air Arabia from Astana to Sharjah with same way of paperwork 2 weeks ago. Air Astana’s consecutive failures went on and we lost vacation bookings in Bangkok."

Demand, that a small instrument, such as violin should be charged 60 euros and then taken to the hold, with the gate controls knowledge, that the flight is half empty is just pathetic and sad. Not to mention that the attitude is just below any normal and respectable manner towards the clients. No other airline does these kind of things. VERY HUMILIATING and SAD EXPERIENCE."

I did so in early September and sent the requested statement from the repair shop indicating that baggage could not be repaired and requesting further instructions or info from the airline. As of this date, September 25, 2019  I have not heard anything back from the airline, despite email requests for them to come to some resolution and contact me.

We had two bags that were over weight by less than 1 kg.  The blonde female attendant militantly yelled, “you are overweight, you must pay 120 euros NOW!”   We could have rearranged the contents in the bags if we had less pressure but she just kept repeating it and yelling the same thing over and over.  The two attendants kept moving toward us crowding us and pointing us to the desk where “we must pay right now!”  It was insane.  They are so militant that I could not think straight.  It was terribly embarrassing and intimidating."
Cameron,"May 26, 2019",Air Baltic,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,4,4,1,0,,,0,No,"I have had multiple bad experiences with this airline. As others have mentioned, do NOT book a flight with a short transfer in Riga. The distance between the Schengen and non-Schengen parts of the airport can be huge, and the incoming flights are frequently late. If you make the flight, your bag surely will not.  Just don’t do it! The other really bad experience I’ve had is with buying tickets on their site. It’s tempting because it’s cheaper than Expedia, etc., but don’t do it!! They don’t confirm that you have the flight at all until the next day, and the website frequently crashes. If you think you don’t have a ticket and buy another one, you may not get a refund if you don’t notice it in time, or if there is any difference in the times. Customer service are robots with no discretion to deal with such situations. If you must fly this airline, use Expedia!"
Oscar,"January 19, 2019",Air Baltic,4.1,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,5,3,4,,,3,Yes,"Perfectly reasonable airline. Very punctual and professional. ESPECIALLY once you consider that this is a medium-low cost airline. I’ve not flown better in this category… perhaps Nowegian could be a great alternative too. Inflight prices are comparable with other airlines. Beats every single US airline I’ve ever experienced and is short on comfort when compared against most premium airlines from Europe. My only genuine criticism is that the staff as professional as they are – sometimes forget that they are dealing with people, so a smile or 2 wouldn’t hurt. I do have to say though that I’d rate it noticeably lower if this was a premium airline, which it is not, though people seem to forget."

Plane an old 737-700, very very old, maybe from the early 00’s. You need to buy everything onboard which is a rip off because condor service is free of charge… at least on my past flights with them it used to be! on arrival everything is a caos, but that’s not air baltic’s fault, Greece is a third world country… anyways, be aware! you get what you pay for… do not expect anything nice from them."

The planes are old without air conditioning, with two propellers on both sides. I thought those are not used anymore. The customer service people look at you with denial on their grim faces , no way you can talk to manager even in Riga, they ask you to us their web site. Even if you use it, they reply and say no way we compensate your losses. Due to their cancelled flight from Riga to Oslo I missed connection to San Francisco. I had to pay for rescheduling and hotel hundreds dollars. Use good airlines, don’t give them your business."
Olena,"August 16, 2017",Air Baltic,4.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,4,1,0,,,0,No,"The worst company to fly. The company is OK selling tickets with a 30 min difference in connecting flights.

However, I only had 30 min in Riga to pass passport control and security. When I tried to avoid the unrealistic connection and fly directly from Riga, the company simply cancelled my ticket and refused to give me ANY kind of compensation.

I had all documents, did check in Newark, only needed to pick up boarding pass at the gate when someone show up! Couldn’t print boarding pass in Newark because United and Air Baltic have no agreement, so they only can confirm your check-in, but boarding pass must be picked up at the gate! When lady show up at 8:15 AM she said I’m not registered.. how did I get to Hamburg then? After she said I supposed to get there earlier to get my boarding pass… Earlier? I was there for over an hours and she got there 4 min ago! Then she said flight is overbooked and someone is seating on my seat!!! Ridiculous! No apologies! No alternative options. NOTHING!  I had to BUY tickets with LOT to get to my final destination! I would give them 0 star and NEVER fly with them! NEVER ! When I claimed Air Baltic, they said I did not show up for my flight! WOW!

The plane we were on was terribly old.In the four-plus hour flight, no blankets, no pillows, no food  no media, no magazines The seating was so tight that even to smallish people like us had our knees pressed up against the seat in front of us the entire flight. Our bags got lost. It was 10:30 at night. No Air Canada agent was present at PDX. We were unable to file a missing luggage report. unless you’ve got a file number that’s issued at the airport, you cannot use the online system. I waited 34 minutes on the phone for an agent. When she answered, her Indian accent was so strong that I had to ask her to repeat every question several times. I had to repeat my answers to her questions several times. She hung up on me."

Rude staff, lost luggage, chaotic management, random cancellation of flights in the last minute with no compensation, leaving passengers overnight at airport with no accommodation. These are all my personal experiences with Air Canada in the last couple of years, and stories like these can go on and on and on. This company is just taking advantage of its monopoly in Canadian aviation to make profits, with absolutely zero intention to improve its service.

Air Canada agent at Atlanta did not allow us check-in two and asked us to pay for the second one. We showed the ticket and request them to check with Expedia and they just said that they can not do anything. We had to send two pieces back and paid for two. Then, Air Canada delayed their flight in Atlanta due to Inaugural show of Canadian Consulate. Connecting flight at YUL did not wait for the passengers (almost 40 passengers). Air Canada staff at YUL behaved very irresponsible and pushed us to board the flights without even giving the boarding passes of our connecting airports. 20 hour flight took almost 80 hours. In this mess, they even misplaced some our bags. We lost 3 bags…all our tour hotels, rental cars and tour packages were cancelled. No cloths to wear after reaching to destination…had to do emergency shopping. When we complained this to Air Canada…they just blamed it on COVID and offer us some discount or coupon on our next Air Canada travel. More of sales promotion."

The entire trip was ruined due to Air Canada losing our luggage.  10 days in Italy, no clothes, essential items, prescription meds, everything in those cases.  It has been 3 weeks since we have returned from the trip and all 3 of our suitcases still have not been returned.  I will never fly Air Canada again.  I feel like I wasted a large sum of money for a once in a lifetime trip for my family and it was all due to Air Canada.  That trip was a nightmare.  Air Canada also doesn’t even accept calls on their 800 baggage number.  I don’t know how they are in business to be honest.  Avoid them at all costs."

We literally cannot reach anyone to find out what’s going on – they don’t seem to care one bit. After flying 11 years internationally, I’ve never had this happen before.

Karel,"June 21, 2022",Air Canada,3.0,Flew Economy Class,7.0,3,4,3,4,4,5,3,Yes,"They are serious. In general expensive, but the service is rather according to the price. I would say they are even severe in their treatment to passengers, which means there are not many smiles aboard from the crew. Sometimes the crew aboard is a bit hard at that. But at least, I have to agree in their seriousness. And from friends with their experiences, cancellations are announced well before the departure time and refunds are complete and timely. Not like Transat, which is a disaster."

Brittany,"June 23, 2020",Air Canada,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"I purchased a refundable round-trip ticket from Denver, Colorado to Osaka, Japan departing on July 31 from Denver to Osaka. I still intended to go until I was notified that my flight was cancelled on May 21, 2020. As per the email from Air Canada, it asked me to cancel the flight even though it was already cancelled by the airline. I did not do this because I wasn’t given an option for a full refund to my original payment method. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) which Air Canada is subject to in this case because the flight originates and ends in the United States, I’m legally entitled to a full refund on my original payment method. I understand that it is the policy of Air Canada to offer a voucher, but policy does not supersede United States Law. I have called numerous times, filed a complaint with Air Canada and the US DOT, and Air Canada refuses to give me a refund. At this point, I will not vouch for this airline nor recommend to them to anyone because of how they are handling this situation."
Jacob,"May 30, 2020",Air Canada,3.0,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,3,1,2,3,No,The service was not great. Tray tables and bathrooms were very gross. The flight attendants threatened to deplane me.  Even after they let me stay they were very rude and also ignored me. The food was ok. After I got off the plane my bag was smashed. I asked customer service for compensation. They were very rude again.
Angie,"May 27, 2020",Air Canada,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"This is a review for an upcoming flight that Air Canada canceled and therefore will never happen. We were to fly to Jamaica from the United States and booked on a flight through Air Canada. So much for saving $100! There were to be 6 of us. They are only issuing us a credit for each of the 6 passengers to use in the next 18 months. I have requested a refund since people in the United States rarely fly via Air Canada, especially when they are travelling south to the Caribbean. I fear I will never see this $1800 again. My major complaint is that they canceled our flight, understandably so, but they did it. They should refund us our money!"

Each have consolidated their flight routes allowing no competition between each other or very little. This allows the airline to charge anything they want.  If fair competition was allowed I’m certain things would change for the better."

It was an expensive $900 Rimowa suitcase that was smashed to bits.  (Please see pictures.)  When we approached the baggage department the lady at the counter was relatively new and after waiting for an hour of her trying to reach someone to help her process a claim, she couldn’t do it.  Not only was it a waste of our time, the problem was never resolved.  She then asked us to reach out ourselves."

Arthur,"February 26, 2016",Air Canada Express,4.7,Flew Premium Economy,10.0,5,4,5,4,,,3,Yes,"Air Canada rescued me two days ago, from a disastrous travel experience with another airline and under the circumstances I can’t praise their professionalism and customer service highly enough. My travel buddy and I were grouchy and exhausted from 10 hrs delayed in the airport in Mexico City when we boarded our Air Canada flight, so when the attendant took my small tote bag from me to store at the front of the plane for take off, I grumbled a bit. He retorted that I’d chosen the seats, to which I answered that I hadn’t. We had paid for premium seats with extra leg room (I’m 6’4″) I really hadn’t been that upset about it, but after take off the attendant brought my bag back, apologized and gave me the # I needed to call for a refund. I explained that it had just been a very long day and apologized, and the whole thing ended up being quite warm and nice. In fact, all the Air Canada staff were equally as courteous, and our pilots were able to take off and land 4 times in some of the worst weather I’ve ever flown in without so much as a shudder. I highly recommend Air Canada for their skill, forbearance, and because they truly seem to care about the quality of their service."
Sheila,"January 11, 2020",Air Caraibes,4.5,Flew Premium Economy Class,9.0,4,3,4,4,4,5,5,Yes,I booked directly on AC’s website. Check-in at Orly was very simple and quick. I hadn’t tried to check in online as we had a hold bag. Boarding was delayed for quite a while (expected due to strikes). The gate was in a very backwater area with just a drinks machine and a toilet.
Vytautas,"September 4, 2018",Air Caraibes,4.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,2,No,"The worst airline ever! They don’t speak English and rarely do they ever reply to you (and even if they do, that will be in French of course). Online check-in is fake – it doesn’t work before the flight and they refuse to help you with that over the phone or email. Their employees at the airport are very unfriendly and completely unhelpful when met in person – you see that you are a burden for them when you need help at the airport. Besides, their airline lost my baggage and it can’t be traced any more at all. All the stuff inside it was lost and they refuse to reply to your emails or messages or, obviously, compensation. CONCLUSION: if possible, try to avoid this terrible airline, it’s the worst French airline for sure, low-costs show you more respect and understanding than this horrible airline. DON’T EVER FLY THEM if you want a pleasant flight and good pre-/post-flight experience."
Steve,"May 25, 2018",Air Caraibes,4.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Extremely sketchy airline. They cancelled our flight back from Paris due to “operational difficulties” and said they could only book us on a flight TWO DAYS later. They would not refund us the money for the flight even though they could not offer anything even close to what we booked. Their customer service just sent us in circles: call this number, call back tomorrow, submit a ticket here, email this address, call this other number. The company hides behind their phone reps, having them continuously say “The company has issued a statement saying they will not refund anyone’s money for the flight”. WTF, if you cancel a flight and can only replace it with a flight two days later you better give customers the opportunity to take a refund."
Veronica,"August 18, 2015",Air Caraibes,4.5,Flew Economy,7.0,5,3,4,4,,,4,Yes,"Overall a good flight. But I chose a seat near the exit in the middle of three seats. The seat was extremely narrow (I’m relatively slim) as there was a solid side underneath the handrest. This meant I was rather uncomfortable until I got used to it. This was made up for by having lots of leg room. I have now flown two return journeys on Air Caraibes between Orly and Pointe A Pitre 2014 and 2015 and each time was quite happy with the meal. I enjoyed the ti-punch (french Caribbean drink) and the presentation of the menu. The film selection was quite small but I liked the films. I did have trouble accessing a film I wanted to see on one flight. Once there was a problem with the AC while we were on the ground and the flight was a little delayed so we were getting really uncomfortably hot. But this was resolved and we took off within an hour. I have always found the stewards to be helpful. On one of the flights I found that water wasn’t brought round often enough. If I could afford the next class up, I’d take it. But basically it’s a pretty good deal (500 euros to the Caribbean in April) and completely acceptable. Direct competitor to AF and Corsair. Similar standard."

The price of the tickets was good and it was the only connection to Taipei which didn’t require a 10 hour-long overnight layover. The overall experience is simply okay. Nothing special. The seats on the A330 were a nightmare, I’ve had more leg room on a Ryanair flights. The entertainment centre was old and hard to figure out. It took me a while to find the movies and I’ve noticed some passengers didn’t manage at all. However, the selection of films was good in my opinion. The food was fairly okay. I don’t know really how the staff was because I didn’t require any special help but for me they seemed fairly okay. There was much more leg room on the A320. Both ways there was no problem with the luggage. The staff at the airport in Taipei was lovely. Overall experience is okay, I believe the price of the tickets is adequate to the quality."
Daniel,"October 14, 2019",Air China,3.6,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,3,4,4,3,1,2,No,"We traveled to Beijing from Houston late October with tickets bought in May. We arrived at the airport to be told the flight was canceled due to aircraft problems to be told the following day that was a lie. Apparently, air China canceled both Friday and Sunday flights months ago but didn’t tell everybody. Now changing a very long, costly international flight is already a very poor customer service, but not making absolutely sure everyone realizes such a major change has happened is the worst I have ever seen in an airline. To make matters worse we had to fight to get a hotel and were sent to a very very poor, dirty one. Food was promised to be included but we got there only the buffet consisting of cold chicken nuggets and old eggs were included. Real food had to be paid. They also have no wi fi available. I travel a lot, have used multiple American and European airlines, being frequent flyer on several. Air China is the worse. Ever."

Also their entrainment it’s just an MP3 Music player, and their freaking headphones are can not use with phones. But other things are perfect."
Aakansha,"April 26, 2019",Air China,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,3,1,2,3,No,"I took my flight from New York to Bombay via Beijing. First the flight got delayed for 4 hours at Beijing airport stating the reason that there is no fuel in the plane. This is very negligence on a part of international airline that they didn’t check for fuel, it’s like keeping the life of customer at risk. When I reached Mumbai Airport, I didn’t get my baggage there and airline employee informed me that my baggage is at Beijing airport, they forgot to transfer my bag to the connecting flight. I got my bags after 4 days at my home with my expensive items missing from my bag. AirChina’s customer service is very bad and they take no responsibility for their customer’s safety and product security. I have contacted them several time but got no proper response. Since my bags was with AirChina entire time it was their responsibility to deliver my bags on time, but it didn’t occur and when I got my bags my items were missing. AirChina is taking no responsibility to help me find my items or compensate me for the loss. Worst service when it comes to safety and security."

I spent 9 hours freezing in Beijing airport with no accommodation offered and another 4 hours in Incheon. Staff were extremely unprofessional, preferring to chat among themselves rather than helping a customer in need. Food was terrible. Luggage was handled haphazardly. Terrible experience."

This Airline is pathetic and I would never recommend anybody to travel by this airline.Regarding the staff support ,Airline food,customer relation this airline has negative marking and most detoriated services ever experienced. Never opt such services."
Anju,"July 27, 2018",Air China,3.6,Flew Business Class,3.0,2,4,3,4,,,3,No,"We flew business call on Air China, and they lost our bags for almost 1 week (which we reported immediately) and did not help us find them. They lost track of them entirely, multiple bags. Furthermore, upon eventual return of the bags there was significant damage to the bags (again, which we reported), but the airline did not follow-up. On our return flight the bags were once again lost. We emailed and called customer service and they continued to give us the run around without any answers. They advised we should have reported the bags lost immediately (which we did). ***Air China is the most disorganized and irresponsible airline we have ever flown with the worst customer service of any company I have every worked with***"
Hugh,"March 18, 2018",Air China,3.6,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,4,4,4,,,3,Yes,"I have recently flown multiple flights with Air China, being Auckland to Beijing return on flights CA784 and 783, Beijing to Chengdu return, flights CA 1405 and 1408. I had read a number of reviews when I booked these flights so was not expecting too much, that said I went ahead and booked flights to China. (For the record I am a regular flyer with Air NZ, Qantas, American and United) I booked our flights on the Air China website, when doing so, make sure you have your passport details ready as you will need them. Remember in most cases you’ll need to get a visa for China. A day before travel I was able to select my seats and print off my boarding pass for the internal flight. Could not print the international boarding pass. Check in at AKL was slow as ground staff (Air NZ) needed to ensure passport and visas were in order, also some time was spent explaining how your bags could be directed to your final destination in China without the need to clear customs at Beijing (this was a great service). Boarding out of AKL was OK. Food on the plane was quite good, just remember to choose the western food as the Chinese options may not be to your liking. I have read reviews about people saying the Chinese porridge for breakfast is ghastly, whether you have this porridge on a plane or in a smart hotel, the porridge in any place is ghastly. The beverages were in keeping with what Chinese patrons would have expected, so no sparkling wines, or white wines though if you like a strong red you’ll be in luck. All of our flights were on 787 Dreamliner except for one on a 777 300 so all good here. IFE was as good as other airlines I fly (noted earlier) With Air China if you pay attention to the detail, then you’ll be alright. Their website is slow so be patient. Despite some small niggles these were vastly offset by the extremely competitive price we paid to travel with them. The other flights we took with Air China were similar to the AKL to Beijing flights, all being punctual."
Chris,"January 16, 2018",Air China,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,3,,,2,No,"Never, ever fly with this company. Their website doesn’t work, they’re impossible to get a hold of by phone & they never return calls. They left my daughters & I stranded at JFK airport for 26 hours with little communication until others on our flight rioted. Air China allegedly hadn’t paid their airport tax so the airport wouldn’t give thematic gate. Their in flight staff ignored my request for some more water & their English was very poor making all communication difficult. I suppose with 1.3 billion customers they don’t need to be courteous to foreigners."

It was New year’s eve so the airport agent in the Dusseldorf airport told me it will take 2-3 days. It arrived after 3 days with broken baggage. I contacted their email and called them to China, Korea, European office. None of them answers phone calls neither the emails I sent them. Refund my broken baggage and compensation that you sent my luggage after 3 days while I had so much essentials goods from Korea!

Raag,"November 21, 2017",Air China,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,,,1,No,My travel agent booked my flights to Macau from Sydney by Air China & Code sharing Air Macau (via Beijing). It was a journey and experience which I would like rather like to forget. Total apathy and disrespect to passengers causing immense discomfort. Firstly – ringing the Air China office in Sydney gets no response – no one cares to answer. Hold for 1 hour and disconnect!!! If you want to do web check in – BAD luck – the site would not open – keep trying!! Luckily if you get connected – it will never take you to end the complete check-in. At the airport – no boarding passes – re check-in at Beijing. At Beijing – no check in counter open that time – Long Wait! International transfer was a joke – 1 km long queue for security check (Not moving for 1 hour as there was only one counter open!! In flight service is forgettable experience – lucky if they understand English! Pathetic food! If you have ordered special meal – forget about it!! Return journey was even worse !! NEVER TRAVEL by Air China – avoid at all costs!
Avinash,"September 22, 2017",Air China,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,,,3,No,"The flight was supposed to take off from Mumbai, India on Sep-20-2017 at 2:35 AM. It was delayed dues to heavy rainfalls which is completely understandable. The problems were – 1) Air China staff at mumbai airport never confirmed the status of flight or any developments. They did not liked people asking questions and replied to every concern/query rudely and denied any responsibility or accountability. Cant blame them, looks like Air china have employed college dropouts looking to kill time and make easy money. 2) No announcements were made about rescheduling of flight or new flight timings. 3) By 6 am, all Air China crew disappeared IRRESPONSIBLY leaving all the passengers hanging. 4) No new boarding passes or tickets were arranged. They are necessary in case Passengers leave the airport and want to enter back to board flight at rescheduled time as per Airport security rules. No guidance was provided in this regards. We called Air China customer support. Obviously they had no idea, what was happening on airport. They spoke very irresponsibly. Worst part was , they had no new information, provided no assistance in letting us know new flight timings. On top of that they transferred the call to Beijing office numerous times where no one picked up the call. 5) Other airlines helped escorting passengers out of airport while your staff just ran away. We have filed a complaint with Department of Transportation. Ref no- ML2017090059."

Well, to my surprise, the intermediary agency (Booking) and Air Europa itself informed me that the reservation was non-refundable. According to them, since it is non-refundable, they will not refund me a single euro of the paid ticket. This seems to me to be EXTREMELY serious and should be brought to the attention of each and every one of the customers who are going to fly with them, so that they are completely clear about the trip before booking a flight with this company, since in case of cancellation they will lose their money completely."

I have flown around the word, it is a family hobby. The charges for luggage is outrageous. 120 euros for each piece of luggage! The service inside the cabin is all about revenue. You get charged for every single drink after the main service. The cabin was disgusting to say the least. I flew from Madrid to Miami . An international fly!  Be aware about the hidden charges."

Compré tres tiquetes con tres meses de antelación y desafortunadamente uno de los pasajeros tuvo una emergencia médica/familiar que le hace imposible viaja (su hijo sufrió un stroke – infarto cerebral). Contacte a la aerolínea buscando alternativas y la respuesta de la asesora al cliente es que solo son causas validas si el pasajero mismo se muere o es hospitalizado tres días antes del vuelo (que tu hijo sufra un stroke no es una razón para no viajar según Air Europa). Le pregunte por diferentes alternativas y NO están dispuestos a cancelarlo, NO están dispuestos a dejar el tiquete abierto/flexible, y NO están dispuestos a transferir el tiquete a otra persona. Literalmente la persona que sufrió el stroke no puede hablar, no puede mover la parte izquierda de su cuerpo, no puede caminar, pero para Air Europa no es impedimento suficiente. Por aerolíneas como esta basura es que el sector tiene mala reputación. Empresas atascadas en los años 90s para quienes sus clientes no son más que un número. He viajado por todo el mundo y jamás había experimentado tanta falta de empatía."

Elena,"December 6, 2019",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,No,"Now I see why Air Europa has such a low rating. We flew by this airline in October from Madrid to Lisbon. There were 2 people in the wheelchairs: my husband and one more passenger. Usually, passengers in wheelchairs are taken on a plane first, along with 1st class/business class passengers. With this company those 2 passengers had to wait until all passengers had boarded and after that were allowed to be wheeled to board. On the top of that we were told to check the carryover because they did not have room on the plane. I refused because in the carryover bag we keep all medications for my husband. They even called the pilot, but, finally, found room for our carryover bag. Ridiculous! I told them that we never flew by any airline that put people in wheelchairs the last to board. Never will use Air Europa again."
Peter,"November 20, 2019",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,We unfortunately flew flight UX015 MADRID San Pedro Sula which was a long haul flight 12.5 hours. From the start the boarding experience was draconian and terribly organised with both elderly and disabled people left waiting on stairs to enter bus to board plane on runway. The food served was not eatable.The staff wanted to charge for a glass of wine to accompany an eatable meal. The flight staff seemed lazy and Totally not organised.Toilets not cleaned. Not even checking safety of passengers and advising safety exit of plane in an emergency. The seating was incredibly uncomfortable for a 12.5 hour cross Atlantic flight. The wait for checked -in baggage on arrival was over 1 hour and 2 suitcases arrived damaged. We never wish to fly this terrible airline ever again.

When I approached my seat (47D), I noticed someone already was sitting there. A crew member came up and told me I was wrong (I wasn’t) and demanded I should take the seat behind it (48D in my opinion). I didn’t argue. Then of course a passenger who had booked 48D came up. The same steward suddenly explained to me that I am plain wrong and that 47F in fact was 47D. It took 2 other crew members to convince the steward that I was right. Unbelievable! A crew that is not aquatinted with seat numbering!! Then of course the usual odd things: Horrible food, 3 Euros for headphones on an intercontinental flight. Of course my steward did not issue the immigration forms before landing, so customs took additional time. NEVER EVER AIREUROPA!!"
Henk,"May 25, 2018",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,Booked a intercontinental flight with Supersaver from Amsterdam to Santo Domingo. Always luggage included intercontinental. Not this time. Without any warning they wanted me to pay extra for my suitcase 250 euro. I decided not to go and stay home. This is cheating. My suitcase was 23 kg. Supersaver had to warnt me about the ticket price that is was without luggage. My trust is now gone and when i ever fly again i need guarantees. Never fly Air Europa again. They know what the problems are. More passengers complaint at the airport. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!
Georges,"May 26, 2017",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,4,,,3,Yes,"I had an excellent trip with Air Europa. I booked a flight from Miami to Tel Aviv on May 13th, 2017. The airplane was very clean, great chairs, amazing tv with a lot of blockbuster and great tv series. The crew was amazing in term of service/help. I do not know why people post these negative reviews. I had a wonderful experience with the plane and the crew. Another thing to consider is the price of the tickets. Air Europa is very cost effective."
Frank,"January 7, 2017",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,4,1,,,2,No,"Worse airline ever, i traveled with my wife and my two daugthers awefull trip, 11 hour trip and if would like to listen the tv i would have had to buy earphones,of couse we got late , and they lost my baggage ,which I need it to picked it up myself at the airport because they couldn’t delivered to ty house, I wait for 4 days ..just the worse experience"
DJ,"September 1, 2016",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Business,8.0,5,4,4,4,,,4,Yes,"The issue with Air Europa is the inconsistency of their fleet. I recognize all the negative reviews, but: they are improving. I definitely can recommend their long-haul business class on the brand new Boeing 787. They do not have any of the discomforts of the older Airbuses that Air Europa is operating: full flat beds; good inflight entertainment and good food. At a price that was less than half of any of the large carriers they took me to Bogota and back. From a price-quality perspective my trip was an excellent experience that I would recommend to anyone."
L,"April 10, 2016",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Absolutely awful airline! The food was dire (salami sandwiches and lumpy pasta); I was shocked that this would even be acceptable for a 10 hour flight. Drinks were sparse and the air hostesses were dismissive and robotic. The organisation was a shambles (staff couldn’t put people into a queue, they kept contradicting themselves, nobody knew answers to questions, half were milling about aimlessly whilst the rest abruptly barked orders at customers) and the flight was persistently delayed; at one point we waited almost 2 hours ON THE PLANE with no explanation as to why we weren’t moving. Babies were screaming, children were irritable, folks were getting angry and the staff mysteriously disappeared clearly to avoid dealing with enquiries. There is no in-flight entertainment and if you want to watch any of their family films (on tiny screens dotted around the plane shared between 30 others) you’ll need to pay ï¿½3 for headphones. Again, isn’t entertainment standard across long haul airlines nowadays? It’s cheap for a reason and i’ll never fly with them again. They need some serious work on customer services and improving their overall image."
Paul,"February 2, 2016",Air Europa,2.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Absolutely awful in every respect. Old planes, surly service, hidden tricks everywhere to get more money off you and you even have to pay for the earphones to watch the inflight movie. Think Ryanair rules on long haul flights with prices only fractionally less than what serious airlines charge. Baggage limits are a con."
Linda,"July 4, 2023",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,My suitcase was delayed on my outbound  flight from Toronto to Montpellier.  I was told at the airport to spend 100 euros on essential and make a claim when I got home.   I arrived home within the 21 days in which a claim needed to be made.  Again my suitcase was delayed on my return flight with Air France with my receipts for making the claim in it.  When my suitcase was finally delivered it was past the 21 day grace period and the claim was denied.
Darrell,"June 12, 2023",Air France,3.2,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I was not able to take this flight. I canceled and they told me because my flight was non-refundable that they would give me a credit. What they FAILED to mention was that if I accepted the taxes back from the flight, it would WHIP OUT THE CREDIT! So I lost $1800.00USD. I called and spoke to their customer service department. I was disconnected several times, dealt with people whom couldn’t connect me with a supervisor, and in one instance dealt with an EXTREMELY RUDE individual who told me to go to the website and complain. I will NEVER FLY with this company EVER!!!"

He replied If you can’t do that go back to your country and he let me to wait until take out my bangles While I have 4 months old baby with me. I had 10 hour transit, so far I realize this is the worse experience and worse manners I have never had. For better customer service for all visitors, every employee need to get training for better manners. I wish you all have kindness. Thank you !"
Lamia,"December 5, 2022",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,3,3,1,3,1,No,Horrible. Horrible food. Headphones broke during regular use. They lost my checked luggage and I ended up with a hideous sunburn scar on my face because my sunblock was in there. Had to go buy EVERYTHING I needed for my trip including clothes in rural Brazil. They didn’t deliver my bag until a WEEK later. Was told by the employee at the airport that I would be compensated 60 euros per day I’m without my bag. Now they’re telling me that they don’t do that. I’ll never fly with this airline again.
Bret,"November 25, 2022",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,1,1,2,No,"I have taken over 100 flights, this (Air France) is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. Cancelled my flight on the way out, and 4 days later did the same for my return flight. Delayed me over 24hrs, made no effort to make amends. Cedric who was working at the Airfrance desk at 11pm on the night 24.11.22, when my flight was cancelled, was totally unhelpful. He treated my situation with distain and had the empathy of a mortician. He made no effort to assist, he did the bare minimum. When I suggested this approach was leading to a bad review for his employer, he smiled for the first time and said “Go ahead.”. Shame on you Air France, and shame on Cedric not valuing his employers reputation. Do not fly this airline, you have far better choices. Let my experience be a warning, not bitten once but bitten twice shy. I will not allow Air France to cancel a 3td flight on me again, twice in a row was enough."
Katherine,"October 12, 2022",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,4.0,3,3,4,1,4,4,4,No,"Two of our 3 flights were on Air France. Cabin crew were polite and attentive. The flights, however, both encountered problems. FIRST flight: Towards end of the flight the cabin crew is giving detailed instructions to the exit row passengers. One of our row mates clocks that there are emergency crews, including a fire trunk, on the runway. We land safely, but the emergency crews follow our plane to its parking place. The pilot tells us that we experienced “technical difficulties”. Handled professionally, but it was still scary. I wonder why the cabin crew waited until there was an actual problem to give instructions to the exit row people? SECOND flight: Night landing. Clouds, but not many. Plane gets closer to the runway we suddenly hear the engines get louder and feel the plane pull strongly upwards. The pilots were aborting the landing. Second attempt was good. Both of these flights occurred on the same day. We will be choosing other carriers in the future."
Chuck,"August 15, 2022",Air France,3.2,Flew First Class,1.0,1,3,3,3,1,1,3,No,"This is the WORSE airline! We arrived to baggage claim in CDG, only for our bags NOT to be there. We were told it was lost, and they tried to deliver it 2 days later. The worker said they tried to deliver it  and should have called us. However, there was NO call. We setup another delivery for August 7th, and they never called nor showed up. When we call or chat with Air France to get it rectified, we get told they are having a problem with baggage infrastructure or that they can’t access the baggage info and the delivery operator will have to call us. Going without 80% of your clothes for 3+ weeks and counting is NOT acceptable. I will NEVER fly Air France again and I will NEVER fly to CDG. Fast forward to today, our experience leaving Paris was worse. We sat in line for 3 hours, ultimately missing our flight. We were sent to 3 different desks for rebooking, only to be sent to another desk. Air France is the WORSE. I don’t care how badly you want to travel to Paris, I would avoid Air France."

Spent days trying to get through to airline only to be put on hold and eventually disconnected.  ABSOLUTELY NO customer service. No one to report to, no answers.  I’m not even going to file a claim as I’m certain it will be a further waste of my time!!!!"
Michael,"July 26, 2022",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,,0,No,"The worst customer service in the industry. Put on hold on the 800 number for over an hour multiple times. Sometimes disconnected. Service reps appeared to be working out of their homes considering the background noise ( children, people cooking…)  and never have been able to resolve the issue."
Ivan,"November 24, 2021",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,3,5,2,5,4,4,Yes,"Great flight from BUD to SVO via CDG with Air France. At the time it is the cheapest option to get to Moscow from Budapest (along with KLM) and is much cheaper than Aeroflot or Wizz Air on selected route (not in general). Flight from Budapest departed on time and breakfast consistent of one croissant is rather modest but I took 3 and 2 cans (150ml) of Cola. There is no alcohol beverages on morning flights, Cabin crew was polite. From CDG I had 1 hour delay, which made me nervous as I had a short connection with separate booking in SVO, but arrival was only 30 minutes late, so not bad. Lunch is already better in terms of quantity (quality is high in general), I took two lunch sets. Legroom is good, customer support as well. I had to change my flight back and it was easy. I checked in my hand luggage as in Air France you can do it free of charge. Next time I fly from BSL to CDG and will also make a report."
Sherif,"June 30, 2021",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Air France casually lost my luggage on a two leg journey from Luxembourg to Paris then onward to Miami. Upon arrival to Miami it was discovered that my bank and many other passengers’ bags did not make the flight. This began the arduous task of getting information from Air France about what happened and the status of my luggage. It is the end of day 4 and no update available. Social media does not respond, calling by phone is fruitless as the wait times is inhumane. I filed a claim that has not even been looked at. Reviewing status updates for both my bag and the claim I submitted yield not a single update. My bag contains clothing needed for my trip, shoes, medication and grooming equipment. The blase approach to customer inquiries and issues is highly unprofessional and demeaning."

Mark,"March 2, 2020",Air France,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,No,"Air France have for the second time in as many trips cancelled my early arrival into Accra Ghana. A flight that was supposed to arrive into Ghana at 17.45 now arrives at 21.40. They didn’t even have the decency to move the outward flight from the original 9.00am departure so as to minimize waiting time. So to recap, their proposal is leave at 09.00 to arrive at 21.40. For a flight to Ghana. Not Hong Kong, Ghana which is around 6 hours away. So their depriving me of one whole day in effect. That seems to be Air France’s default approach, make the passenger worse off. The last time I flew with them (to my Father’s funeral) they cancelled my Saturday departure and put me on the Sunday flight. Around an hour of phone calls later I was moved to the Friday service. And during that flight I never did receive the glass of cognac I requested post my meal. The first time I have flown with a national carrier and wasn’t served cognac as part of the bar service. This time around, again I’m worse off. I will never choose this carrier again"
Jay,"July 12, 2019",Air Iceland,5.0,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,Yes,"We missed a late evening tight connection in Toronto. Air Iceland (Icelandair) took great care of us by putting us in a upscale hotel adjacent to the airport and arranging priority booking on an early flight the next morning on a different airline. On another leg of the flight, in the seat directly in front of us, we observed a male passenger who had imbibed a little too much, firmly and very diplomatically being handled by the chief flight attendant. We were attended too very professionally on all legs of the international flight round trip flight."
Alessandro,"April 9, 2017",Air Iceland,5.0,Flew Economy,2.0,2,3,3,0,,,3,No,"Arrived from CPH and flew from KEF to Akureyri, you must check-in in the baggage claim hall after you pick up your luggage, and that’s still ok, but then you cannot move from there till you pass the security controls. But the security controllers arrived only 45 minutes later so with other passengers we wandered in the baggage claim hall like fools with nowhere to sit but the baggage belts cause no chairs were available. Finally we where admitted to the departure hall and could drink a beer but then when the flight was called we went to reach the gate and discovered that the gate was on the staircase and we had to stand 20 minutes with other passengers, many of them sitting on the stairs. Once on the plane, seat belts fastened,  we waited more than one hour cause 1 passenger had to arrive from  a delayed connection! Incredible! Icing on the cake: in Akureyri I collected a broken luggage….."

Staff is nice and the food is really good, but the seats are not comfortable, so honestly not worth the extra money. Upon arrival, as business class passengers your luggage is supposed to be given priority, however it was the very last to arrive for all business class passengers. One of the reasons I was flying business was to have that priority so I could make my connection without rushing… I had to run unfortunately…"

We were promised a  hotel accommodation at Delhi airport by the Air India telephone operator at Chicago, and also check in counter at Chicago. On arrival at Delhi airport at transfer desk at Air India- it was another story. There was lot of confusion. We were told to spend night at airport- were told that it will take 2 hours to look for hotel, and we have to return back to airport by 3 am for 6.50 flight. 4 Different AI employees looked at Boarding pass at different  times. Rohit was an employee- who challenged me to complain against him, and made us wait at airport. and then got us hotel at 12 midnight, with 2.5 hours wait and aggravation at Delhi airport for no reason.

Air Stewards response to my wife “Madam, the flight is full. If you wish to be seated with your son, you will have to negotiate with your fellow passengers”.

Joseph,"March 28, 2022",Air India,3.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,3,4,2,No,"When I entered the Air India plane, there was a slight sensation of stale air. Apparently they had not used a air freshener before boarding the passengers.. During the 15-hour flight from Vancouver to New Delhi, none of the tv screens in the plane was working. An apology for this failure was announced over the speakers. All the passengers had to endure the sheer boredom throughout the 15 hours. AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services at any time. So mothers with infants had to go to the galley and fetch the water themselves. Throughout the flight people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water to drink. For lunch they also put the snack meant for tea, so crew can be spared the effort of serving again.  It was so deplorable I cancelled my return trip by Air India and booked on Lufthansa instead, even though I lost a substantial amount of money by doing so.

Jeremy,"June 19, 2019",Air India,3.8,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,No,"So I flew Air India once and never, ever again.  We flew domestically from Agra to Varanasi.  First of all the plane looked like it had never been cleaned…black stuff smeared all over the walls, dilapidated seats with rips and tears and a “black grime” on the seat.  I wiped it down with a cloth and the cloth was black when I had finished.  Then saw 2 cockroaches.  The “food” was half a stale sandwich, and we payed extra for business class.  The plane was barely airworthy.  Scary scary flight.  I think safety is a serious issue with this airline, I really have never felt unsafe on an airplane until Air India.  Also timeliness isn’t their strong suit.  Air India is in the news almost daily for something maintenance related or something totally insane.  They should’ve made Jet the national carrier and scrapped Air India.  Very unfortunate that the Indian flagship carrier has fallen from a good airline to a safety hazard."

We needed to fly from Yangon to Kawthoung in the south for one week at the Myanmar Andaman resort on McLeod Is. I phoned them before we travelled and they blatantly lied to us saying that they were the only airline that flies to Kawthong. As we transferred on the Saturday and they informed me they do not fly on Saturday, we had to book hotels for two nights. The flight down was on an ancient turbo prop with the two stops, so 3 landings that felt like the whole plane would come apart at any second it shook and rattled so bad. Then on Sunday to fly back we go to the airport at 9 am for our 10:30 am flight back to Yangon. It was deserted and we felt like we had finally made it to the twilight zone. At 11:00 people started showing up for the other two airlines that we were told did not fly. So I phone KBZ air and was told there is no flights on Sunday, but we had a ticket! So they sold us a ticket for a plane that does not exist. We finally got 2 of the last 3 seats on apex the newest airline with brand new turbo props (highly recommended)."

I have contacted Air Malta several times to explain problem without results. They have now had my money for almost 2 years. Never ever AirMalta. "
Adam,"July 28, 2021",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Business Class,9.0,5,4,4,4,5,5,4,Yes,The flight was very good. Covid-19 was taken care of very well. Cabin Crew were the nicest people ever. Definitely recommend this airline to Friends and Family.
Herman,"September 26, 2019",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,No,"Bought my flight through an aggregator site, so I wasn’t able to pay for bags. Tried to pay for bags on their site, they couldn’t find my confirmation. Called customer service, wasn’t able to get a person, only got voicemail. Left a message, no one called back. Went on their site and bought bag vouchers for €50. When I got to the airport there was no record of me paying for bags even though I showed a printed voucher. Had to pay another €80. When I reached out to customer service they refused to help or issue a refund. The flight was also delayed by an hour. Worst airline!"
Severine,"July 24, 2019",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Bad customer service ! Bureaucracy, bureaucracy, bureaucracy to get a reimbursement !!! Checking online not working well. Food and drinks onboard running out. Miserable, unhelpful crew on board Never flying Air Malta again !"
Laurie,"June 6, 2019",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy Class,4.0,3,3,2,0,3,1,0,No,"Every time there is a problem with check-in. Instead of having designated check-in desks for each destination they have about five for all destinations. This causes all sorts of problems as each flight has differing takeoff times. If there’s a huge holdup in your queue with everyone going to different places that the earlier flights have the danger of either missing their flight or spending so much time queuing you get no time to have breakfast before boarding. Travelling to Heathrow from Malta in April this year the computer in our queue packed up. Instead of using some intelligence and splitting our queue into other ones which were working we were simply standing waiting. I had got tto the airport early and spent almost an hour in the queue just standing. In the end I jumped queues as I was worried I might miss my flight. The check-in staff are very slow, the slowest out of all the many airlines I’ve travelled with. Last December’s check-in was chaotic and as they had overbooked some passengers couldn’t even board. Every check-in I have with them is hell. The only trouble is I have to use them as there is no alternative."
Andrea,"January 3, 2019",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,"We departed on the morning of Dec, 24th from London Southend with slight delay but the captain told us that thanks to favorable winds we would arrive earlier in Catania (Sicily). When flying over the city of Palermo the pilot announced that due to Mount Etna eruption the airport of Catania would have been closed and we would land in Malta. We were all surprised: there are at the least 5 airports nearby Catania (Palermo, Comiso, Trapani, Reggio Calabria, Lamezia Terme), all suitable for a transfer by bus but this airline decided to land in Malta, (a tiny island surrounded by sea): I can imagine that RyanAir would not have decided to go back to Ireland nor Easyjet to UK. Soon after the captain announced that we would land to Comiso (Sicily) so we proceeded: when at a few feet from the ground the airplane gained again altitude and our hopes were again broke by the announcement that because of the strong winds it was not possible to land in Comiso and would proceed to Malta: other flights landed at the same time in Comiso so I don’t believe it was not possible but probably the pilots were not able to do the maneuver. We thought that we would have just a short delay: as soon as we spoke with the Luqa airport AirMalta ground staff and the Info kiosk staff we realized that we would not have any change to spend our Christmas with our families. Air Malta staff appeared unaware of our redirected flight and was unable to answer our requests for assistance. Malta is connected regularly via ferries and speedy boats to Sicily but the Air Malta staff told us that there would have been an announcement in 20 minutes time. Twenty minutes passed and so 40 and so 1 hour and the staff from the help desk were abandoning their seats till when there was no staff at the front office. Passengers were worried, and we started asking for bottles of water and lunch voucher but they kept saying there would be an announcement in a minutes. We could have been transferred to Sicily by ferry boat or speedy boats but instead Air Malta spending time agreeing a strategy: useless to contact them by phone as the operators were keeping saying that the number was only for reservations. After 2 hours standing up, without drinking nor eating, a person (it is impossible to say if he was from Air Malta or from the airport because did not have any identification nor introduced himself) told us that we would have the possibility to go on a flight to Rome but that we would have to arrange our transfer by ourselves: I don’t know the level of education in Malta but the fact you arrive in Rome doesn’t mean you are close to Sicily. All of this on Christmas Eve, when all transportations are fully booked. All passengers agreed that we was not an option and, frustrated, angry and stressed by the lack of assistance received started talking with the front desk until an answer would have given. After an hour the staff told us to move at the check in desk for the flight to Rome that would land in Catania first. We moved at the check-in desk but the staff at the desk was unaware that would land to Catania and denied us to check in. After 45 minutes standing up in front of the desk the first passenger received the boarding pass. The flight was planned for 19:00 but I received my boarding pass at around 19:45. No monitor was mentioning Catania nor our flight number was matching with any on the screen: we just knew we had a boarding pass for a flight in the past to Catania in our hands. Finally we have been advised to proceed to a gate and we went on the airplane at 8.30 pm. The flight was already in extreme delay and the crew was going back and forth counting the passengers on the flight (they were searching for someone and they did this five or six times) delaying even more the departure. We would have already been in Catania if the flight would have depart at 7 pm or 8 pm (it just 20 minutes flight) but at 9 pm the staff told us that we would have to get off the airplane because Catania Airport would be closed starting from 9.30 pm. The passengers didn’t want to follows this order and the captain went out from the cabin and called the police. The situation was unreal: children crying, an adult having a crisis that required the assistance from a doctor (among the passengers), the police shouting against passengers saying not to shout until when they started forcedly removing our hand. At that point we had no option than return to the terminal. Again here we passed 3 hours and we received no kind of assistance. At 11 pm the Air Malta desk told us that 2 flight would have been placed for us the day after to Comiso and that we would have to check-in at 5 am; they told us also that we would have been granted with a meal voucher and an hotel room: we were diffident after all the breached promises by Air Malta. After 30 minutes queuing I received my light meal for the Costa Coffee and a 1 single bedroom hotel room: the staff kept saying that we would have to use an app called Taxify to arrange our transfer from and to the airport. Nobody wanted to get stuck in Sliema (a town of Malta where the hotel was located) because of lack of transportation on Christmas day so the majority decided to sleep on the ground or in the seats of the Costa Coffee in the airport. It was impossible to ask for a quite environment as there was a Christmas concert in the airport so nobody managed to have a proper sleep. The time passed, very slow but at 5 am we queued at the check-in, we received our boarding pass and we arrived in Comiso at around 8.30 am on Christmas day; from Comiso a shuttle bus has been arranged to bring us to Catania airport, were our parents were waiting for us: it would have been impossible to reach our destinations without the help of our beloved on day without any kind of ground transportation. We arrived at destination with more than 20 hours delay, we stood up on our feet for more than 8 hours, we did not drink for more than 5 hours, we did not eat for more than 9 hours, we will never trust Air Malta again."
Jill,"May 30, 2017",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"We flew back from Malta to Gatwick on this Airline for the first time and thought it was great.  Cabin crew were very nice; seating adequate for economy, would recommend it."
Vito,"October 30, 2015",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,3,No,Arrogant staff. My 2 year old child started crying due the steep descend and then steep ascend being that the Airline could not land in Catania Airport due to traffic. The silly Hostess acknowledged my child’s anguish and decided to walk up the aisle with her hands over her ears with a sarcastic look. Typical Maltese Arrogance!
Joerg,"October 30, 2015",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy,3.0,2,2,2,0,,,1,No,"Flight from Vienna to Malta, which was not on time. Leg room was poor, in-flight service non existent apart from a complimentary cheap baguette (no choice offered) and a bottle of water. There wasn’t much of a difference when compared to a budget airline, but the ticket was considerably more expensive."
Alain,"October 19, 2015",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,4,1,1,,,1,No,"Repeatedly the airline left me on the runway spite of overbooking. I had been told that I could collect my compensation at destination. Airmalta said they did not receive anything from my place of departure although the airport proved it to me. Disorganization, dishonesty I don’t know, but unacceptable treatment of passagers this is sure. The staff of the airport of departure told me that Airmalta is known to be unreliable. Not wishing anyone the same experience. The file is not cleared till date."
Andre,"October 18, 2015",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Economy,4.0,2,3,2,0,,,2,No,"MLA-FRA-ALG, I should complain about them as two weeks before my flight they cancelled it and accommodated me on the second leg of the journey with another airline, with a horrendous schedule! but the service in general was basic, club sandwich with a bottle of water, flight on time, staff disinterested, ticket was expensive, no in flight entertainment, would not fly them again, unless they are bargain."
Mark,"November 16, 2014",Air Malta,4.0,Flew Business,4.0,3,3,4,0,,,4,No,"Flew from Malta to London in business.  I’d purchased extra luggage just to be safe and then realised that I had a business class ticket.  I emailed in and asked for a refund for the extra baggage that I purchased as it was not necessary nor was it used, Air Malta denied my request and decided to keep my money.  Did not think it was fair at all."

From the first moment on board each crew staff really transmitted happiness. It was like to start vacation when still on the plane, although I was travelling on business purposes. I liked the food, that had some tropical touch, maybe Mauritian one. And I was totally impressed with the Business class: not only because it was so comfortable to sleep on totally plain bed, but also with each single detail – every item in the cosmetic travel bag was selected with such a care, and the food was great (I also had a special food of raw fruit – like being on the beautiful island). It was like to be in Mauritius while still being on the plane. Thank you the great team and crew of Air Mauritius!!!"
Travis,"January 10, 2020",Air Mauritius,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Worst customer service of any airline I have ever flown — and I fly every month. They cancel flights all the time because of poor sales, forcing customers to fly on the following day. They provide you with no compensation for this, even though I had to stay in Mauritius for an extra day with my partner. When I asked them to reimburse me for food and hotel, they refused."

Unfortunatly my wife was taken seriously ill on the flight home and I would like to congratulate the airline on the way they dealt with the situation in calm, efficient and caring way. The ambbulance was waiting when we arrived and ground staff completed a smooth and quick transfer. Apart from this incident the flight was good, boarding well organized ,flightbcrew attentive and meals of a reasonable standard. The only down side was the out of date entertainment system with all films starting at a commont time and poor selection."
Anne,"July 19, 2017",Air Mauritius,3.4,Flew Economy,1.0,3,2,2,3,,,2,No,Delay with mechanical problems from Mauritius to Perth. Parents were stranded due to poor service. Parents stayed in Perth overnight because HO in Mauritius were unable to be  clear and concise in delivering information or making decisions. I lodged a couple of complaints to their office and received a measured response where they were very quick to pat themselves on the back for job well done. To date this issue is not resolved. Thinking of going to VCAT in the next few weeks. Watch this space… it will be called “Spotlight on Air Mauritius”. I have travelled over a dozens of time with them and service has not improved in that time and I am justified because I was promised a call and so far both call & emails are being ignored. They forget that they exist because of our patronage.

Crew were not just unhelpful but sullen and rude. Given the people we met in Mauritius we’re friendly and helpful I think it’s time for mass retrenchment of aircrew and recruit staff who actually want to work and do a job well.  Never answered crew call button I had to go and find crew (sitting chatting at back of plane) for water, blanket etc.  One hostess even responded to a request with “you think you’re at home?” Seriously!? To top it all my son and I ate the chicken and both contracted campylobacter which ruined 6 days of a 10 day holiday. NEVER, EVER will I fly Air Mauritius again and certainly won’t recommend them. I will find the time to relay this message as far and wide as possible. Sharpen your act people, the worlds a competitive market place and other airlines fly your routes, good luck on making 51yrs!"

EDITORS COMMENT: Unfortunately it doesn’t matter who you fly with, if you are on the cheapest fare that’s not flexible you have no options no matter what the circumstances.  It would be the same for every airline with that ticket type."
Joel,"November 11, 2016",Air Mauritius,3.4,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,4,,,5,Yes,"I was really worried about flying with air mauritius reading all the reviews.

Katherine,"January 10, 2024",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Premium Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"Everything about the flight exceeded my expectations, from the super-friendly service to the NZ craft beer and cider, to the compostable food packaging, restaurant quality food and the latest movies.

Wolfram,"May 9, 2023",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,1,1,0,No,"Absolutely incompetent airline. My wife and I were booked on flight NZ580   We did the online check-in the day before and waited at CHC airport, printed out baggage tags and boarding passes. Then when we put the suitcases on the drop of belt, my suitcase was accepted without any problem, after a short passport check by a staff member and disappeared. My wife’s suitcases were rejected and the staff member was at a loss. So we had to wait 15 minutes for a supervisor to explain that our flight was cancelled . I then had to walk all over the airport to get my suitcase back. After 20 min, that was also done. Then we had to print out tags and boarding passes again and go to the drop off belt again. In addition, my wife would now not be seated next to me. At 8:05 a.m. I received a text message telling me that the flight had been cancelled. I have rarely experienced such an unprofessional airline. Of course, there was no apology, just an “engineering problem”."
Paul,"March 4, 2023",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Aircrew are great, but totally let down by their abysmal customer service.

Mikey,"September 22, 2022",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,No,Had a booking with Air New Zealand in August. They had changed my flight time to later in the day. After contacting their phone lines and waiting all day for a call back they explained they couldn’t do much and I would have to pay an over-the-phone fee for them to change anything. Upon checking the link they had sent over SMS it was redirecting me to a page not found. After messaging them on all social media channels I finally got a reply 1 month after the flight had already been finished. Not the best service from AirNZ. Also noticed they don’t do a safety demonstration on the aircraft besides pointing out the doors. There are many tourists that may not understand the videos and need a visual demonstration. Quite a disappointing experience from a government-owned airline with premium prices that don’t come with a premium experience.
Ales,"September 8, 2022",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,9.0,4,3,4,0,4,5,4,Yes,"Keep flying with these guys domestically on semi-regular basis. Good service, great value if you buy your tickets in advance."
Romiel Melvin,"July 31, 2021",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,The airline that always puts safety first and it’s customers it’s top priority. From the start of checking in the seem less service of ground staff are so friend and when you get on board the aircraft the Kia Ora from the cabin crew and friendly smiles all around. The service on board is always so personable and they definitely go the extra mile. I always recommend Air New Zealand to all my friends and family. Looking forward to my next flight.

Paul,"December 27, 2019",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Business Class,3.0,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,No,"Travelled Business Class from Melbourne to Buenos Aires. Paid a premium price. Very poor value for money. Probably the most disappointing experience in business class that I have had. Poor experience started at check-in and didn’t get better. The seats are a very strange layout – having the feet of the passenger next to you in your face is not pleasant for your eyes or your nose, with no privacy at all and are uncomfortable for sitting and sleeping. For the Melbourne – Auckland leg, my seat had food scraps on it, and stains (I had to ask the flight attendant to wipe down my seat before I sat down), and the TV alcove had dust and food in it. The staff were unhelpful and quite brusque, especially when I went down to the galley to ask for some water – there were three flight attendants, and all of them looked at me as if I was imposing on a private discussion. Finally, the food was nothing special, and compared to BC on other airlines, AirNZ does not come close. Will certainly consider my options next time, and not sure why AirNZ have been given Airline of the Year."
Kate,"November 28, 2019",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,3.0,1,3,2,1,4,3,1,No,The strangers next to me summed it up!   ‘Budget airline’.  This was during a flight Brisbane to Norfolk Island.     The movies are $10 if you want a decent one.    Apparently there was a broadcast about ordering a meal because that is also extra.  I only heard a mumbling  and ignored it.    I was wondering when I was going to get mine while only a few around me received theirs. The frugality began when I went to choose my seats and was advised that would be $10 per seat. Prior to this flight I flew Qantas Perth to Brisbane and then Brisbane to Bundaberg and back to Brisbane.    I had free food and wine and movies.  I chose my seat on the longer flight. For no cost!!     I paid over $1k to ANZ for return trip to Melbourne via Sydney not Brisbane.  Unfortunately Air N Z has the monopoly on Norfolk Island though I predict that will change. Overall very disappointing indeed.
Daniel,"October 14, 2019",Air New Zealand,7.5,Flew Economy Class,8.0,4,4,5,5,3,4,4,Yes,"Flew on Air New Zealand’s longest flight from Chicago to Auckland. I enjoyed the flight, the in-flight entertainment was responsive and had many options, including some TED talks. The meals that we were served tasted very nice, but there was no L&P available, which is a signature drink of New Zealand. The staff were very friendly, some having conversations with the people in front of us, which was nice to see. During the sleeping time, the crew were walking up and down the aisle every half hour or so with water for the passengers that were awake. Definitely would recommend to anyone with the option."

I finally arrived in the capital from my domestic flight. The delay meant that i had missed all connecting flights. My onward flight was with them and so they rebooked that but when i asked about the rest, the did not care one bit and just quaked the ticket contract. As far as they were concerned they would get me to where they originally intended regardless of whether i had the abilities to change all my other tickets, which obviously i could not. For them, as long as they still got you to the location, the rest was in no way their responsibility. They are an expensive low quality airline with abysmal customer care and service"

Service both on ground in in flight has greatly improved, as has the food. Recently I travelled from Port Moresby to Nadi with my husband and children and had a great flight experience. This however could not be said for our return flight from Nadi to Brisbane with Fiji Airlines which was absolutley apaulling. They should take a leaf out of Air Nuigins book and learn a thing or two. Well done Air Nuigini."
Lucas,"July 18, 2013",Air Niugini,4.7,Flew Premium Economy,0.0,1,3,1,2,,,3,No,"I was flying from Popondetta to Brisbane via Port Moresby using Air Niugini as i have dine wvery month for the last 2 years. The first flight (Dash-8) was delayed. When I arrived in Port Moresby I was not allowed to check in for my flight to Brisbane even though there was 1 hour before departure and I was assured when in Popondetta that I would be allowed to board the flight. Air Niugini instead booked me in a flight to Cairns and said that someone would be waiting to assist me with a connecting flight to Brisbane. When I got to Cairns all Air Niugini staff had gone home. I was stuck in a town I had never been to, without accommodation and without a connecting flight. I then rang Air Niugini Australia for assistance and was yelled at by the Australian National Manager . She somehow told me it was my fault. This was not the first time Air Niugini had avoided responsibility for stuffing up my flights, but it will be the last. I have prevoiusly had items stolen from my baggage which was locked and several packages marked ‘fragile’ have been broken. I have since booked all flights for myself and my employees through Virgin Australia and Airlines PNG and have not had any problems. I would not recommend Air Niugini to my worst enemy."
Roy,"January 5, 2023",Air North (Yukon Air Service),7.0,Flew Premium Economy Class,8.0,5,4,5,0,5,5,0,Yes,"I flew Air North return from Vancouver to visit a friend in Whitehorse in 2019. Both flights were event free, comfortable and punctual. The air crew were pleasant and helpful. Due to the short distance there were no refreshments but that was hardly a concern. I had to return to Vancouver earlier than planned so ended up with funds on credit from the cancelled light. During COVID I decided there was little likelihood of using this credit so I requested my money to be refunded. It took a few reminders by email but each message was answered promptly and I was refunded by bank transfer. Top marks for honesty and customer service."
George,"July 11, 2017",Air North (Yukon Air Service),7.0,Flew Economy,5.0,4,2,4,1,,,5,No,"Airline says flights are full when they are not. In eight consecutive flights, have never had any space beside me. And because airline claims that the flights are “full”, they can never place me in a row with an empty seat. Which is okay for a midget on a short haul. Very uncomfortable and unaccommodating."
Gareth,"January 3, 2017",Air North (Yukon Air Service),7.0,Flew Economy,8.0,3,4,5,0,,,3,Yes,"I recently flew Economy on Air North from Whitehorse to Calgary in light snowy conditions [as expected in Whitehorse]. Everything was on time and captain kept us well informed on time and weather updates throughout the short journey, even cracked a joke mid-flight.  Staff were fine,  offered beverages throughout the flight. The 737 seemed a little out dated, but i would trust flying on Air North again for sure. All in all, it was a pleasant little trip."

Free bag, meal and cookies is a plus. They also make passengers power down electronics and remover earbuds way too early. 30 minutes prior to landing and before the cabin doors are closed. Brutal especially for kids. Baggage also took forever to arrive at the carousel. Flight attendants were better on return flight than departure but still not friendly."

When working in Yukon I always fly Air North from my base in Vancouver; they have consistantly been one of the best airlines I have ever flown with.  I have flown the Vancouver –> Whitehorse route on their 737’s multiple times.  They have outstanding customer service (with a fresh baked cookie or piece of cake on every flight!) that stands in stark contrast to Air Canada, and if I recall correcty they have been on time for almost every flight.  All in all, flying with them is a great experience and highly recommended."

We send an email to the Reservation center – they replied straight away but gave us a much higher price than was shown on the website! While I went back and forth with them, trying to clarify the price and get a real one, I got, like, 4 different prices from 4 different people at the Reservation center. The day after, trying a different credit card, I managed to book the flight with the original price. I do hope the flight itself will go well…"

My last flight with them was 3 months ago from Abuja to Owerri. Their check-in was OK, but they only allow 20KG baggage for economy passengers. Our flight departed on time and even ahead of schedule which I really appreciate. The cabin crew were very nice. Although, they could work a little on their cabin and legroom and the tray table of a particular seat was broken. Nevertheless, Air Peace is still one of the best Nigerian airlines out there. I recommend it for you."

We all ended up having to spend an extra €200-300 buying new clothes, bags and toiletries, not to mention losing $1000 worth of belongings that I am being refused compensation for."

I called the call center and they said I had to pay 90e because of the price difference. In the meantime, I had to reschedule the flight for 09.07. and again to pay another 50e. Due to the impossibility of traveling, I wanted to postpone the flight again, but since I no longer knew for which date I wanted to leave the ticket open and use it until the end of this year, which they did not allow, and I had to choose another date and pay 50e again. In the end, I did not want to pay for the postponement of the ticket again, and I asked for a refund. I paid 300e for the ticket and they only refunded me 55e for airport taxes. I couldn’t get the rest of the money because the flight was operational. Btw they don’t reply to e-mails and the call center can hardly be reached."

Maja,"December 3, 2019",Air Serbia,5.4,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"The worst airline I have ever used! They have a monopoly  on certain routes, so the prices are extremely high even if you buy tickets largely in advance. For example, for a short flight on a route such as Milan-Belgrade, the price is never under 200€, for a basic tariff, where the service is equivalent to the one of low cost companies (i.e. only hand baggage, no food/drinks, free check-in only if done online etc). So, the passenger pays very high price for a ticket without basic services. I would also mention that other airlines decided to exit the market for unfair competition, so a passenger has no alternatives if he wants to fly direct. I also had bad experience when they just canceled my return ticket, probably for overbooking. When I asked for explanations, the stuff was extremely impolite and I never got my money back. One day before the flight for which I bought ticket two months in advance, I had to buy another ticket with  another airline."
Valter,"March 13, 2019",Air Serbia,5.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Worst low-cost airline of all time.

They refused to issue us boarding passes because we did not have onward tickets after Nepal. We told them we plan to cross the boarder by land from Nepal to India. The supervisor told us  she will check and disappeared. We waited in the airport until  our connection flight was boarding. By that time, we’ve purchased our onward ticket from KTM to Delhi, but when we showed our ticket to them, the first thing they said was we cannot boarding our flight because the gate is closed!! Then the supervisor demanded to see our INDIA VISA, which was completely irrelevant. In the end, they did not let us board our flight even though we had the onward tickets. We were dumped in the airport without any explanation and help. We ended up sleeping in the airport, none of their staffs asked us if we have food, water or blanket. The next day, we boarded the flight with exactly the same documents we had the night before, which means we could’ve boarded our original flight!!! We did not need to sleep at the airport and we did not need to go through this mental and physical torture!!!"

Anirban Dutta,"August 2, 2016",Air Seychelles,1.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,3,,,3,No,I wanted to bring to your attention the pathetic experience I have recently had flying Air Seychelles and its partner Etihad on the Mumbai-Dar Es Salaam-Mumbai route. I had booked an confirmed Air Seychelles flight Mumbai-Male-Dar-Mumbai (PNR:JY4MS) on January 2016 for flying in July 2016. A month later we were informed that Air Seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi (PNR:NXCBKX). I had confirmed with the Mumbai office of Air Seychelles and the flight was confirmed. A week before flying I checked with Etihad online and they informed me that my Abu Dhabi-Dar es Salaam sector was not confirmed. Neither Air Seychelles nor Etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation inspite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in January! If I had not followed up I would have been stranded in Abu Dhabi. The Air Seychelles ground office in Mumbai was equally clueless. Repeated emails from them to Air Seychelles and Etihad (on highest priority I was told) went unanswered. Only after I threatened to take Air Seychelles and Etihad to consumer court did they swing into action and book us on Kenyan Airways. As a gesture we were informed that a sp

My husband and I bought tickets from Air Tahiti Nui to go to Tahiti for our honeymoon. We had a connecting flight with another airline. My husband and I paid an additional $60 through Air Tahiti Nui so we could sit together on a 8 hour international flight. Due to a flight time change, our ticket numbers changed. Air Tahiti Nui’s system did not sync with the other airlines system. Therefore, Air Tahiti Nui lost our reservation AND sold our seats that WE paid for! Then, Air Tahiti Nui blamed US for changing our ticket numbers..I’m not sure how that is even possible to do on our end! After going back and fourth with Air Tahiti Nui for 2 hours at the airport, they found 2 spots for us on the flight. However, the seats were NOT together despite the fact we paid an additional $60 to sit together. Absolutely ridiculous! No wonder their reviews are so low."

They will make you late, make you miss your connecting flight and leave you to sort your problems out at your own cost without any help. Unbelievable. It cost us an extra $248 to sort out flights because their plane had a technical issue. Their problem, their fault they admitted. They promised to compensate at the airport and then later using fine print reneged on their responsibilities."

Cheapoair says Air Tahiti Nui will give me a refund minus over $500.00 for penalties. This is a WORLD WIDE PANDEMIC.

The A340 is old, the economy seats are terrible, very thighs and with an uncomfortable headrest. The quality of service and food poor. In Business Class the seat is of course large but not at a level of a business class of long haul flights. Food is very poor and not comparable with any business class I have flied before.

We had flown overnight from Perth to Auckland and had a long wait for the onward flight so we weren’t in the best mood.  A delay in the flight made things worse and the airlines ground staff at the gate were unhelpful.  Announcements were made only in French which was a little confusing.  The staff for the flight home were much better.  After sleeping through our alarm, we almost missed the flight but this time the airline staff were very helpful and kept the check-in counter open late for us after we rang ahead.

I purchased the ticket for 1800+ k and on my dad’s way to the hospital, he had a severe pulmonary emphysema illness where he was taken straight to the ER. I called and canceled the filght and informed them of the situation. They asked me to provide the documentation of the ER in order to get a credit, which I did. They refused to either give me a voucher or credit for my dad to travel.  They require that I purchase a new ticket in order for my dad to travel.  They are very rude, unprofessional, heartless, cruel people that I have ever seen.  Do not travel with this company.  They also have fake customer service number on their website when you call them to spend 3 hours on hold and can’t never speak to an agent. Run away from them, they are bad!!!!!"

Total fail by both companies!  When showing up for initial flight operated by Air Transat, was refused boarding and handed a phone number to try to fix it.  After about a half hour on hold and speaking to heavily accented employee, found that they’d changed my booking to several days later.  No emails, no notice whatsoever, no offers of compensation, nothing.  If that wasn’t bad enough, when I eventually took the flight they rebooked me on, upon arrival at ticketing for the second leg of my trip (this time operated by Porter), I was again refused boarding.  This time they said I owed them a large sum of money (twice the price of flights booked) and would not be allowed to board until it was paid.  Upon contacting both Air Transat and Porter (both at ticketing and through their phone line), both claimed it was the other’s fault.

They are not willing to work with you at all and take your money any chance they get. Not only were the employees checking us in useless but so were the phone lines. We had to prior notice of vaccination requirement and had to miss our flight. We were told that if we called the customer service number they would help us rebook with a small fee. After being on hold for 10 hours I was finally able to talks to someone and they let us know that they would not do anything and we would have to book a whole new flight. Terrible experience, never flying with them again. KLM is way more helpful and care about their customers. Would not recommend!"

The cancellation also never returned all the money, with Air Transat stealing about 60 CAD from my money that they never returned. So, cancellation at short notice, theft and if you call, you can spend for hours waiting for them to answer the phone. Worst airline of them all. Try any other one. Too bad there are no zeros for these ratings. In a past flight, back in 2017, my baggage wasn’t there and I was sent it two days later, having to use the same clothes for all those days. WORST."

Not been able to speak to a single person, despite waiting hours on the line. Contacted them via social and they say you have to call to make changes and that’s the only number.

We knew booking this flight that they do not serve food on this airline and that is ok. We planned to buy food on the plane because it’s a 5 and a half hour flight from Toronto. We waited 3 hours until the stewardess came to us and by this time we were dying of thirst and starving. They proceeded to tell us that they ran out of all of the food items except chips and chocolate. The stewardess were very rude and did not even apologize for anything. I believe that every person makes their own memories and reviews but coming from a person who has taken 16 flights in the last year, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline."

I had been in a serious car crash months before and now was in Italy without a stroller. WORST SERVICE EVER. I am writing this review after 3 years of trying to get this sorted through the company.

FA fussing over her daughters giving them freebies ,even pilot had to mention the special daughters on flight Not impressed after being extorted customers service non existent with this fly by night airline Price paid more than what I pay for Air France or TAP to Europe but not much choice for Glasgow This is an airline that flies old planes charges full price yet has less service than ultra low cost airline Never again"
America,"October 2, 2019",Air Transat,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Transat charged my credit card without my consent six months after the trip. After six months of my trip, my credit card was charged with 30.00 dollars. After several phone calls to the customer service and waiting time on the line (30 minutes last time), they told me that it was a baggage charge. I was so surprise because at the time I booked my trip online, it didn’t show anything about that baggage fee and later in the airport nobody said to me anything related to an extra charge for the suitcase. I always assumed that it was included in my expensive travel ticket, more than a 1,250.00, and then Transat acted like a vulgar robber, charging my credit card without my consent six months after the trip. I do not recommend this airline, you cannot trust on them because you never know when they are going to use your credit card to charge you anytime they change their policy. It is neither serious nor professional and they don’t show any respect for you, your privacy and your money."
Wolfgang,"July 18, 2019",Air Transat,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,No,On May 26 my wife and I were booked on Transat from Porto to Vancouver. As usual I wanted to check in 24 hrs prior to departure but the system (I used all of of your web sites and also 2 different browsers in case of cookie problems) did not accept my attempt telling me I should call a number which I could not reach from Portugal with a Portuguese SIM card. After 2 hours of attempting to make either approach work I finally called a Montreal Number (514-906-5111). The agent told me that we can only check in 24 hours prior to departure of our CONNECTING flight from Montreal – very unusual nonsense. Nothing worked
jim,"May 24, 2019",Air Transat,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,No,"Booked October 2018 for flight in May 2019 from Calgary to Glasgow. Airline wanted extra fees to sit with my wife and additional fees for baggage. Online app was not functional and Baggage Fees icon did not work so we paid an additional $280 CDN for our bags (Calgary to Toronto, Toronto to Glasgow, and return). Attendant at airport in Calgary told us to go online when returning and save 20% on baggage fees but our confirmation # didn’t work and we were unable to access online. Again, 7 months booking flight and they wanted extra fees for us to sit together on a flight with numerous empty seats……….a definite “cash grab”. Food was inedible………worst I’ve ever seen. Return flight ordered Pasta which was burnt (I mean absolutely black!) and was told no replacement available. Watched seat in front of me with “upgraded” service offered a small bag of chips or a chocolate bar……..ha! So, original fee increased 25% so absolutely not worth the effort. Plane from Glasgow to Toronto……left side audio did not work and plane was from Wright Brother’s hangar………..no leg room so must have been when people were shorter (1800’s) due to malnutrition. Seriously uncomfortable."

My husband and I have flown Air Transat to Spain in 2009, Amsterdam and France in 2010, Italy in 2014, Ireland in 2016, Czech Republic in 2017 and my upcoming trip to Slovenia and Croatia this May.  We have had no problems whatsoever with AirTransat.  We always pay extra for the Options Plus package which we feel is well worth the extra few dollars.  If people want all the extras and/or luxury travel then maybe they should book on a different Airline.  We like this Airline for the price and especially for their non-stop flights.  We’re definitely looking forward to our upcoming trip in May flying on AirTransat!"

Because of this company delaying and cancelling their flights I have been travelling for a total of 3days instead of 1 and a half. It’s my first time flying on my own and this has ruined the experience for me. No explanation as to why it was cancelled and then delayed a further 11 hours. I’d rather pay double the price than fly with them again. Also no apology was made for this 11 hour delay and the extra two hours on top of that making it 13 hours. Thank you for my worst experience Air Zimbabwe! Never EVER again !

Flight was delayed by hour and a half .. with little explanation and no offer of coffee / tea / drink.  Plane was shabby both outside and inside .. somewhat of a worry!

When I contacted Customer care a day before departure I was told I could pay at the counter before boarding the flight. However, staff at Mumbai airport (manager Anish and team) were harsh, rude and insensitive to my situation by denying any mode of payment and were demanding only cash. Me being NRI did not carry any INR and had limited AUD with me that I wanted to use for inflight meals etc. However, they were very demanding and rude and gone to the extent of sneaking into my purse and persuade me to exchange my AUD into INR right at the airport to pay them in cash. This is worst professionalism you can display in any industry. When I resisted they ordered my baggage to be removed and board another flight which is not just against Air Asia business model and customer service but against any level of humanity. After one hour of argument and losing my energy ending up with sore throat they have accepted my card payment. This was all not before I realised i am running late and in danger of missing my flight. They may boast about most affordable airlines but I strongly advice any traveller not to fall into the trap of cheap air tickets by Air Asia and avoid being ripped off with appalling service and ridiculous staff."

Which also affected our connecting flight from K.L to Goldcoast-Australia. Thankfully, the staff member by the name of Ni Luh Seri Mertassih at the Air Asia Customer Service counter – Lombok Airport was approachable and helpful did all necessary arrangements for us to be on board the last flight leaving at 11.55pm from K.L to GC. We were very appreciative of her assistance and pleasant mannerism at time of urgency to connect a flight for us without hesitation. She did her best and was polite. We like to sincerely thank her for such excellent job. She is a great asset to the company. Thank you Seri – From : J & P Burgess Note: Perhaps, Air Asia Indonesia can schedule their flights to leave on time could be an improvement to avoid passengers missing their connecting flights."
Matt,"December 20, 2016",Airasia Indonesia,5.5,Flew Economy,1.0,0,3,1,0,,,0,No,"Booked CTU-KUL-DPS, arrived early in Chengdu and could check bag through to Bali, but unable to print boarding passes or check us in for second leg. 5+ hour layover so straight to transfer desk in KL who then gave us three seats each several rows apart. Ordinarily not a problem except one of our party was only 2 years old. Told there was nothing they could do as had not paid extra for assigned seating but could ask again at the gate. Did so as soon as gate opened but told was within policy, there was nothing they could do and should ask on board. On board told that we’d have to sit separately, including our 2 year who would be 5 rows away from nearest parent. Eventually agreed we could ask to swap with other passengers, but couldn’t wait at front of plane or on bridge until other passengers had boarded as this would delay boarding and would have to wait until everyone had seated and could then swap if time allowed before takeoff. Hardly an option trying to get a 2 year old to sit on his own in a strange environment among strangers and out of sight of his parents so picked two random seats together and explained to original occupants who took pity on us. Will not fly Air Asia again."
Rery,"September 13, 2016",Airasia Indonesia,5.5,Flew Premium Economy,1.0,2,3,4,4,,,4,No,"I have travelled with Air Asia many times and normally i am quite pleased with the service. However, i booked my parents a Premium Flex flight from Darwin to Denpasar for Sunday September 11, 2016 with consideration of my mum is in wheelchair and i was hoping with choosing premium flex it will make their trip much more easier. Unfortunately they had unpleasant experience. This has been very very dissapointing for me, and I really want to know what your respond is. As mentioned in premium flex benefit is to have express baggage/ priority baggage collection at check out, this did not happen. And my elderly parents both in the 70s was left standing and waiting to collect their own luggage with no assistant from any Airasia staff. I paid an extra $36 per fare for this service and it did not happen. I further attempted to book red carpet so they will have assistant to and off the plane but the Airasia website was not clear and i cannot see the function. Further to this i am very dissatisfied with the service as I paid for the service that I did not receive. Due to this i will probably never fly with airasia again and i will not recommend premium flex to anyone booking a flight!!"

But due to the volcanic ash my flight to Denpasar a week earlier was cancelled and I was unable to get to Denpasar for my Holiday.     I called Air Asia Indonesia a week before my flight and told them of the situation and informed them I would not be able to take the flight from Denpasar to Perth and I requested a refund. They asked me to lodge a reimbursement request online. A week later the refused to refund my money. My girl friend caught the flight we were booked on and Air Asia resold my seats to other passengers and still refused to repay me.  I’m disappointed with Air Asia Indonesia.

red,"April 28, 2014",Airasia Indonesia,5.5,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,4,0,,,4,Yes,Have flown twice PER DPS on A320 in last six months with AA. On time on both occassions with scheduled 3 hr 40 min flight. No frills airline with the ease of direct booking from AA website. If you plan ahead you can get some cheap return flights for around AUD 200. The good thing about these low cost airlines is that they broke the GA & QF strangle hold of years ago where by you essentially had to buy a packege including accommodation to fly to Bali. Now with the internet you can book your flights and accommodation seperately. Big thumbs up for Air Asia as a low cost no thrills airline.

Sean,"March 25, 2014",Airasia Indonesia,5.5,Flew Economy,8.0,5,4,4,0,,,4,Yes,"Perth-Denpasar Denpasar-Perth A320. Value for money is why AA Indonesia is our first choice for our Bali trips. $140.00 AUD return for our last trip (Feb 2014) is hard to beat, have flown Garuda, QF/Jetstar, Virgin, Simpati and Air Paradise in the past and the only one that beats AA is Garuda executive class. Pluses: The aircraft are new or nearly new and well maintained, the seats are ok for shortish flights, the staff are mostly pleasant, and the food is surprisingly decent considering the cost. Minuses: The complete lack of any entertainment, seat-back videos, tablets, nothing- paid or free. We think where most people who have problems with AA come unstuck is their lack of understanding of the reality of low-cost air travel and unrealistic expectations. Maybe they need a large “NFI” (not for idiots) warning on the welcome page of their website."
Pearl,"February 16, 2014",Airasia Indonesia,5.5,Flew Economy,3.0,1,2,2,0,,,0,No,"I booked two flights with AirAsia, the first one was from Jakarta to Bali and from Bali to Melbourne. The first problem I encountered was a change in flight (which apparently, on this website, seems to be common and not unusual at all). Jakarta has really bad traffic jams in the morning so giving waking up at 5am to give myself 3 hours to get to the airport was annoying. I have two bags with me when I go to Bali because I ultimately am moving to Melbourne after my holiday. When I get to the counter, I find out I have to pay airport luggage fees (roughly 5 USD/pound) for my extra luggage (one free check in-up to 20kg only) So I end up paying over 200 USD for an extra luggage. Okay. My fault. I did not check the website clearly and it was my own responsibility to ensure I followed the luggage rules. When I get to Bali, I speak to a representative on their website to help me add a luggage to ensure that does not happen again! I IM chat with Mac, a representative and plainly state I have two luggages: one is 20kg free check-in and I need to add one more. After 10 minutes he “upgrades” my bag to 25kg. I specifically ask him, upgrading to 25kg means im adding an extra bag weighing up to 25kg correct? He tells yes this is true. So I pay the upgrade and worry no more. The morning I get to the airport, I find out I have to pay for the extra luggage anyway! the free “20kg check-in” does not apply anymore because I only upgraded the free check-in from 20kg to 25kg! this flight from Bali to Melbourne had two sectors so I had to pay double. I am really disappointed and unsatisfied with the representative that helped me because I was trying to avoid exactly what had happened. I paid over 500 USD to transport my luggage even after I spoke with someone to help me add on luggage. I am an international student and I thought AirAsia was going to be a good option for me to go abroad and save money. It turned out to be the opposite. The unpredictable change in flights and hidden baggage fees just made things more difficult on me.I will not fly with AirAsia anymore nor will I recommend it.  I am not upset about the first baggage fee as I take responsibility for that but the second time, the company/representative failed to assist me. Hopefully this company can examine what happened here so that another customer is not cheated from the company’s bad communication."

I had a travel plan from Kuala Lumpur to Europe, and one of my changeovers has to be in Chennai Airport (MAA) for several hours. But I wasn’t allowed on board due to, as I was told, specific transit requirements as was said by the airline (Air Asia) I had a flight with. They said there is no transit area in MAA and due to this fact I need a transit visa to proceed in my journey.  I checked all the information before regarding transit through India and it was said everywhere that if the layover is less than 24 hours there is no need for a transit visa. I also checked specific requirements for MAA but found nothing and was sure everything is going to be fine. I have no idea what happened, I received no further explanation from the airline (I tried to contact them but they have just a chat bot which not allows to connect to person), but my trip was completely spoiled and I had to buy different expensive tickets on spot, my losses were USD 1500+.

However, to my greatest disappointment, all my attempts to cancel and refund my flight via Malaysia failed. It is impossible to reach them, which shows fear of any feedback because they realize how atrocious their customer service is!

Yes, I agree with comment of flight crew being too casual in wearing denim jeans on board, first time for me to see such attire for crew and they all have this sultry look as Ã­f they are too good looking to be serving on such budget carrier. After numerous experiences with difference budget airlines on different routes just to try them out, I think I prefer to pay a bit more to travel with full service airlines for many reasons that budget carriers will never be able to match."

The only number available to call anyone for help is long distance to India and after waiting on hold for an hour, they say they only handle domestic flights in India.  At least the Indian guy confirmed that there is no other number and you have to “chat” online, and the wait is over an hour for that too.  And there is no countdown to your time to chat, and no audible alert when your agent is available, so you have to stare at the screen for an hour and hope you happen to see when they show up.  If you don’t respond within 60 seconds , they end the chat.  If you are waiting for the agent to type or look something up for longer than 60 seconds, it ends the chat.  So you have to keep typing “still here.” Absolutely ridiculous."

If I add to that the antiquated airplane and the uncomfortable seats, I would recommend everybody to avoid AirAsia."

Or, like we did book an aisle seat for the wife and a window seat for yourself and hope no one will book the middle seat. We have tried it (more than once), and there is a better chance of winning the lottery. As you would expect from a budget airline everything is cramped and rushed – but you get what you pay for. 🙂"

Be very careful with this airline, mainly if you are booking your ticket from Thailand. They DO NOT PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Only live chat is available, which is not even live chat, it is automatic response chat. If you spend  20 minutes chatting with ´AVA´ , they connect you to the live chat, which is not working. We wasted 2 whole days and the only thing we needed was to change the date of our flight. We were not able to contact anyone, they have no email, no online support, no phone line number. When we tried to change our dates through their amazing app, guess what, it was not working! We lost 2 whole day trying to contact them, therefore we lost the opportunity to change our tickets 48 hours before our flight and now we are in loss. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND AIR ASIA.

And I regularly still do it on a bi-monthly basis as my house and family reside in Bkk. Not surprise, then, that most of the air hostess already know me well. This to say that I don’t have any complaints about the rendered service. Normally on time, friendly staff and reasonable catering for a low cost company. My only remark regards the ridiculous use of pre-recorded messages that are broadcasted during the 2.30 hours flight. Security warnings, of course. They are mandatory and we get used to them. But being flooded with totally useless messages during the flight and at a very high level of sound is really bothering me, namely, by not allowing to take a rest when I fly on the 6.35 am flight. “Hope your meal was good”, “Now you can buy cheap articles” and so on… a never ending story. Really annoying!! I think that during the time of the flight, only for 30 mns we can get some silence. I hope that this sound pollution policy can be revised and allow the passengers to have some deserved rest."

Every passengers can carry 7 kg on hand but my kids are still young(7 and 4 years) and thus we prepared 2 hand carry bags (15 kg for total).The problem started at on board at gate number 31.The staff at boarding gate told us to check-in our bags and we explained that we have extra empty bags and thus we can transfer to them. But she shouted and said our bags must be checked-in. We said we don’t have any other stuffs to carry but she kept our passports and refused our request. She shouted us very angrily in front of many people. Finally, we paid 2000 bahts for 2 bags to checked-in. We feel that it is really bullied our rights to carry 7 kg hand carry for each person and unfairly taken 2000 bahts. Moreover, the staff at the gate is very rude and we requested Thai Airasia to take an action to that staff. But, Thai Airasis did not take any action to that staff according to the reply from their customer care staff .If they do not take an action to the rude staff, I’m sure other budget airlines(e.g Nok air) will take over their markets in the future."

David,"December 21, 2015",Airasia Thailand,4.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,This airline has pretty bad customer service.  I checked in on line and entered my bags and weight.  The website told me how much it would cost.  I printed my boarding passes and went to the airport.  The website never asked me to pay for the bags.  At the check in counter they told me I did not properly add my bags and charged me 3 X the website quote.  Nobody would listen or care.  I was so frustrated paying over $100 for two bags when it would have been $36 for locals who know how to navigate the subpar checkin process on web.  Then I get on plane and they won’t give me a drink of anything on the flight because I didn’t know you must pre purchase food and sodas before you take off.   Only locals with the app were getting served.  It took me an hour of reading to realize you have to pre pay for a soda in order to get one.   I will avoid this airline if possible.

Daniel,"April 23, 2019",Airasia X,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,2,1,1,,1,1,No,A customer relations disaster that has still not been resolved in 2 months. Horrible first point of contact in KLIA2. She refused to give her name when asked because she knew how poorly she handled the situation. Still have yet to actually contact someone who can do more than tell me that they are “working on it” and I should continue to “wait”.
Stuart,"December 31, 2018",Airasia X,3.2,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,,,3,No,"AirAsia – premium flatbed – 20/11/2018 D7237 PER > KUL, AK886 KUL > DMK. Having flown with this mob for the last 10 years I know what to expect, they are a LCC, it’s why I always fly premium (their version of business ‘J’ class), it’s perfectly reasonable to expect a better service than cattle class but it’s basically for the angle flat seat so at least I’m not crammed in like a sardine, and sometimes I can even get 40 winks. They say any premium seat bookings are fully flexible, change without extra charge, but that’s bollocks as inevitably there isn’t any seats at the price originally paid, so there’s always extra to pay. Over the years they have probably screwed me over an extra $2K with these fees.! Just this one alone cost me an extra $890. Other issues have also occurred over the years too, like lost and/or damaged baggage and other smaller issues like advertising priority check-in at certain airports when none exists and damaged/broken locks, no hot water in the toilets/showers at their lounge. But this most recent trip would have to have been the worst I have ever experienced, with any airline. Normally I would fly PER > KUL > CNX, but for some reason they had no flights to Chiang Mai in November so I had no choice but to book another flight DMK > CNX, but within Thailand I prefer to use Nok air rather than Thai Airasia. So I allowed 4 hours 30 minutes between flights, more than enough time for clearing immigration and check in, even if there were flight delays. So only 1 hour and 10 minutes before AK886 was due to depart I get an SMS (and email) informing me it’s been delayed by 3 hours. As check in for Nok air closes 45 minutes before departure, 45 minutes to clear immigration, collect luggage and go from T1 to T2 for check in at DMK, just not enough time. But as a precaution (remember I know what this mob are like) so 2 months earlier I decide to book a cheap seat on FD3429 DMK > CNX as, shall we say ‘insurance’ incase they stuff up, then at least I have a seat to CNX, but I didn’t bother putting any luggage on it. If you have been to KLIA2 you will know it’s one of the worst terminals at any airport and of course D7237 parked at the last airbridge at the end of the satellite terminal, felt like 1k to the transit area. So I get this SMS and go to the transfer counter, but no they can’t help there, they direct me to another counter, but it’s in the main building, over the skybridge. There I encounter the rudest, most belligerent customer agent ever, not only could I not get a word in edgewise, it would be reasonable to think that as they have stuffed me around, guaranteeing I will miss my Nok air flight and as I had booked a precautionary Thai airasia flight they would at least add the luggage for free, but no, there was no way she was going to do that. Not only have they caused me to lose the entire Nok air flight, they want to add insult to injury and charge me for the bags. And this is the way they treat a premium customer, god help those poor souls in cattle class.! Finally AK886 leaves 3 hours and 27 minutes late, not happy Jan….. What if I hadn’t booked FD3429, what would they have done, nothing, left me stranded at DMK on the second busiest day on the Thai calendar, it was Loi Krathung festival, all flights would have been fully booked. Just not good enough, if I could give them 0 stars I would. Honesty and integrity is in short supply with this airline, if you can use another, give this mob a miss. Thai Lion have a nice new A330 with the exact same seats but they are only using it on the DMK > HKT (Phuket) run, the sooner they realise it could be more profitable using it on long haul to PER the sooner I will use them as I am so much over these idiots."
Kay,"November 23, 2018",Airasia X,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,1,3,0,,,3,No,"We bought return tickets in early March 2018, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Osaka in end October 2018. There were 2 cancellations made by AirAsia without notice or whatsoever. Both had no notice or email given until we noticed the changes ourselves when we were on the website. The 1st cancellation was made somewhere in June to early July, original flight to Osaka canceled and they moved it to 2 days later than the original. We filed complaints through email and Twitter, and expressed our dissatisfaction on the cancellation and changes without notice immediately, and request for flight change as the date is not preferable. Entitled for free reschedule, we moved the date to early November. The 2nd cancellation was made soon after the reschedule done in early July till early August, same scenario as previous, no notification! We noticed the changes ourselves in the website, filed another complaint through Twitter, and the only thing we can do is either get a refund or free reschedule. Nothing else. Noticed there were complaints about the delays and difficulties in getting the refund from AirAsia, we decided to make another flight reschedule to late November. Our departure flight now is 1.55am on 24 November (tomorrow). And this early morning (today) we received an email informing us that there will be a delay in our flight for 2 hours. We are now so frustrating and yet worried there will be another delay in the flight later. Another note, the response from AirAsia’s customer care or support team is very disappointing. The response received from Twitter somewhat acceptable, which they took about 5 hours to 1 day to reply, but as long as you have decided the date to reschedule to, they somehow managed to get it done quickly. However, there was no response from our email complaints about the first cancellation that we made in mid-July, until end-August where we have already made our second reschedule (in mid-August) after the second cancellation without notice. And the email was only reflecting the first cancellation and first reschedule that we made in July. Soon after the email, Cancellation Notice was sent to my inbox to notify the first cancellation, after 2 months, and it wasn’t even valid at that time anymore."
Andrew,"April 26, 2018",Airasia X,3.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,,,1,No,"I just returned from Osaka to Honolulu with Air Asia X and have to let everyone know about their shady practices which border on being an outright scam. I booked the flight because of the low cost so I understood that it would be a no thrills flight. We had to pay for water on board, which was fairly lame but I did not mind too much, until the flight attended was completely rude to us and demanded the two dollars before he went and got our water, as if I would stiff him once the water was delivered. This however was minimal compared to the issue to come. My ire developed when checking in to the return flight from Osaka. I had tried to purchase all add ons in advance, food, checked bag fees and the like. Bag fees when booking online was 30 dollars a piece. I paid for 2 checked bags. We ended up taking an extra bag, and on the return flight they instructed us that we had to pay the “counter fee for checked bags” which was $123 dollars a piece!! $246 dollars extra to check 2 small bags!! This is tantamount to extortion as they know we have no choice but to pay the inflate charge because we are obviously going to take the flight and need our bags. This is a scam and the worst business practice I have encountered in my life of flying. They obviously know they are doing something wrong because, this happens often. Around us as we were checking in , no less than 10 other passengers were irate due to the same situation. After all of their fees, I ended up spending as much as I would have on a regular carrier with better service. I will never fly with them again and I do not recommend anyone else flying with them either."

In every case of booking they’re only a few ringgit (or whatever the booking currency was at the time) cheaper.  I know they’re a budget airline but they charge for EVERYTHING including checking in at a desk instead of on a machine. The latest experience I had I tried checking in twice on the self check-in which would not allow me to. After going up to the desk (and still being over 1 hour prior to flying time) the attendant said he would charge me for being under 1 hour and also for checking in at the desk. He told me to try the machine again, which still didn’t work.  Nonetheless, he charged me RM 21. What angers me is the staff doesn’t seem to use their brains, but operates only on protocol or what the machine tells them. YOU ARE A THINKING, PROCESSING, DECISION-MAKING HUMAN. They need to invest more money into staff training because a majority I’ve encountered cannot help me.  Another thing is I asked 3 different people (check in counter, phone assistance, sales counter) to enter a previous flight in the system so I can get the Big Points and nobody could. Don’t fly this airline if u have another choice"

Buses to Aircraft because airline to lousy to use gates. I am 69 years old and they put me in the only row that doesn’t recline – row 11. They charge to have a seat in an exit row with extra leg room but no discount for putting you in a non reclining seat.  Zero leg room is another issue. I always thought Jetstar Asia was one of the worst airlines in the world but AirAsia now tops that list. My advice is to avoid this excuse for an airline like the plague….
Anna,"July 14, 2017",Airasia X,3.2,Flew Economy,2.0,1,3,3,1,,,1,No,Very disappointing.

I purchased a sandwich on board with an expiration date of 18/7/17 – consumed on the 14th  – and it was dry and disgusting. Could not eat it it – let alone enjoy it. Imagine what it would  taste like 4 days later?! I paid for a seat which was in an emergency exit. There was virtually ‘no brief’ on our responsibility in an emergency.  All intercom information was indecipherable – could not understand a word. It was like flying ‘blind’.

To the extent that they even bothered to answer my request for a refund, I was given the answer that “it was in the process” and “I would be refunded in a near future”. Still today, June 2020 NOTHING has happened and keeping in mind that I traveled with AirCalin in end November 2019, this is unacceptable. The whole matter was that I had booked AND paid for seats with extra leg space (Flight between Tahiti (Papeete) and New Caledonia (Noumea)). This could not be accommodated on the return trip. Really bad customer service – disrespectful and basically just stealing from their clients. I will most likely NEVER travel with AirCalin ever again and I highly recommend anyone and everyone to avoid travelling with AirCalin as they apparently only keep the money/steal from their clients for services they cannot provide."

But no, we remained apart. Back home, I called Alaska and asked if they could do anything. No. This airline is simply as lazy and indifferent as all of the other domestic carriers."

Kay,"February 16, 2022",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,8.0,4,4,4,3,5,5,2,Yes,"I’ve flown Alaska several times. I’d say The quality of their flights (in-flight entertainment, food, service) have declined in recent years from excellent domestic to middle of the pack, but they have one of the best frequent flyer programs in the business. They partner with a whopping 24 airlines. They also allow rabbits in cabin (a rarity among airlines) which is great since I have two. Their network has shrunk quite a bit since the pandemic hit but hopefully their range will rebound in the next year or so."
Paul,"July 1, 2021",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew First Class,4.0,1,2,5,0,1,5,3,Yes,"First flight w/Alaska. PIT-SEA, 737-900. First class. 6/27/21 Cabin didn’t smell right. FAs friendly and attentive. Steak salad was not so good. Dry lettuce and cabbage. Very dry roll. No butter available. Seat cushion was sat out, became uncomfortable about halfway into the flight. On time arrival. Experience at baggage claim poor. An Alaska employee using the PA system directed passengers from our flight to the wrong carousel. The info board was also incorrect. After an hour wait, I got into a long line of people with baggage issues. The employees who helped me eventually said my bag had been dropped at a different carousel. – I’m looking forward to the return trip as I’ve heard good things about this airline."
Donald,"June 12, 2020",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew First Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,1,1,No,"I booked a flight and purchased first class upgrade when I checked out. A week before I travel, I get called and told I’m on a different flight, but that my seat is still in first class. Apparently, I was bumped to “premium class” without knowing it. When I approach the counter they say “sorry” we have no record of you purchasing a first class seat. Then they promised me a beer on the plane – I don’t drink.  I call customer service and they tell me I’m definitely in first class and “not to worry”, that it was a computer snafu.  But on the plane they jam me into the back. Definitely never flying Alaska again."
Pamela,"April 11, 2020",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"We booked flights back at the beginning of February 2020 to fly the first week of April 2020 to Alaska. Then COVID-19 turned into a huge issue. We cancelled these flights at the beginning of March 2020. These were booked as non-refundable flights. Since Alaska enacted a policy in March 25th, 2020 that all visitors to Alaska have to self-quarantine for 14 days if they come to Alaska, I called Alaska Air to see if there was any option for a refund and was told absolutely not. I can have a credit towards a future flight. Great, when the economy is the toilet and my husband was laid off, we can rest assured that at least we can book our vacation later in the year. I understand policy under normal times but with everything going on, we are more interested in paying our mortgage than we are in taking a vacation anytime soon."
Mike,"January 29, 2020",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Outrageous, Inflexible, Punative and Unforgiving Change Policies: I purchased a round trip Seattle-Boise ticket.  Plans changed and I needed to simply drop the outbound flight.  I called MVP customer care and was informed that to simply drop the outbound flight I would be charged a $125 change fee.  I was not asking for any kind of refund but for the “privilege” of dropping the flight I was being asked to pay more than I paid for the original round trip ticket.  Net effect is I’m being asked to pay twice the price for half the service. If I only needed to drop the return I could have simply not shown up and no additional cost but because it was the outbound flight, they had me over a barrel.  You would think Alaska might appreciate the opportunity to sell the seat twice. Lesson learned – never book Round trip tickets if you have any inkling that you may need to make a change – Book two one-way tickets instead.   Looking for a new airline to take my MVP Gold business."

Leila,"August 29, 2019",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,2,2,1,1,3,3,3,No,"Usually late, rude flight attendant removes passenger from plane for no reason -delaying the flight even more.  Was she racist? An incredibly rude flight attendant had a person taken off the plane for no reason at all. She had stood up to check on her bag but sat right back down, The flight attendant who was rude and scowling ever since we embarked told her because she broke the rules she was going to be taken off . The passenger was not arguing or disruptive and immediately complied by sitting down.but the flight attendant Kaitlyn said because she broke a rule she was being taken off It took about an hour to return to the terminal, remove the passenger and then taxi back out making us all late. Flight attendants should have the ability to remove a passenger but not to just use that power if they don’t like someone. The passenger she had removed –who again was not arguing or disruptive and had immediately complied and sat down — was African American. Was the attendant racist? Would she have done that if the lady was white?"

Edward,"July 4, 2019",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew Economy Class,8.0,4,3,5,4,5,5,4,Yes,"We flew from Fort Lauderdale to Seattle. One, the leg room is inadequate (I am 6-2). Two, the schedule is inconvenient. In the summer there is one flight per day on this route compared to two in the winter. The summer departure out of FLL is around 5:00pm which means you arrive in Seattle at around 10:00pm. In the winter, however,  they have a morning departure out of FLL so I do not understand why they cannot make their summer departure in the morning as well. In any case, none of us wanted to repeat landing so late in the evening so on our next trip we booked on another carrier. Alaska, we love your non-stop on this route so make it a morning flight out of FLL and I promise you I can talk the rest of the family into booking with you all."

The thing I liked the most is that they always give me surprises like carrying of the infant baby, extra baggage offers, free cancellation policy and much more. Once a time my baby got scared by the noise of airplane while taking off, the air hostess named Miss Nadia Cruz help my baby in this critical situation, the way she deals with this situation was an eye-catching experience for me. Therefore I recommend you all to have booked with this Airlines to know more about amazing offers and deals. whatever is my issue Alaska Airlines phone number @ 1855-477-7283 will help me out in any conditions."
Gregory,"May 25, 2018",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew First Class,2.0,3,5,5,4,,,4,No,"On two separate occasions, in the last six months my daughters were bumped from paid first class seats to the main cabin. In both cases we had purchased first class airfare well in advance of the flight date and, in both cases, upon the day of travel we were downgraded from first class to the main cabin. The first event occurred in November of 2017, while my daughter was traveling from SEA to IAD for her 30th birthday. I had purchased her first class airfare as a birthday gift and checked her in the day before to verify everything was ready upon her arrival at the airport. She had no luggage [to check] so she went directly to her gate and waited for boarding. Because she was expecting to receive the services of first class, she did not eat or drink before arriving at the airport. Unfortunately, as she was boarding the plane, she was informed of her downgrade and told she would need to contact customer service to receive a refund of the price difference. The explanation provided was mechanical issues that resulted in a new plane with fewer first class seats. After my daughter’s departure, I contacted customer service and was provided with a refund of the difference between the main cabin and first class seats; I was also provided with a $150 voucher to use on a future flight. My daughter, on the other hand, received a free drink and had to pay for her own food. The second event occurred May 7th of this year. My wife, my youngest daughter and myself were traveling from SFO to SEA to visit one of our other daughters and our grandchild. We were also celebrating our daughter’s 21st birthday so I purchased first class airfare for all three of us. The airfare was purchased two months in advance and, once again, I checked in the day prior to ensure everything was good. Unfortunately, on the way to the airport, my daughter’s seat number disappeared from her electronic boarding pass. Upon arrival at the airport (2 hours prior to the boarding time) we were informed that my daughter had been bumped to standby and her seat and the one next to her were given to standby passengers for “security reasons”. We were asked to speak to the representatives at the gate in order to attempt to get my daughter a seat on the plane. Once we arrived at the gate we spoke to the representatives (it took three people to figure out what was going on) and were able to get my daughter a seat in the main cabin but were told they could not provide her with a first class seat. When we asked why, we were told the decision came from higher up and the representatives could not provide us with a reason. As compensation, we were provided with food vouchers and $200 vouchers to use on future flights. We were also told we would receive a refund of the price difference between the main cabin and first class but we have not received a refund as of yet. On the plane, my daughter did receive free food and beverage service but we found out that her seat and the one next to her were bumped to the main cabin so Alaska Airlines could accommodate two MVP Gold 75K members eventhough there were multiple main-cabin seats available. I understand that situations arise and sometimes decisions need to be made that may not be in everyone’s best interest but, in the case of our recent trip, Alaska Airlines made us feel like my daughter wasn’t good enough to be in a first class seat, and that is beyond unacceptable. Not only did Alaska Airlines give her seat away but they gave it to someone they feel is more important than her. I emailed Alaska Airlines and their response was: “Unlike many other airlines, Alaska continues to offer our customers the option to request their desired seat assignments at no additional charge. Regrettably, our staff is occasionally faced with the unfortunate task of having to involuntarily change a ticketed customer’s seat assignment, which can happen for a multitude of reasons including security reasons. However, I can assure you that such changes are not undertaken without due consideration and are only done when absolutely necessary for operational reasons.” So apparently, the “due consideration” was those other people flew more often and spent more money so they deserved first-class whereas my 21 year old daughter didn’t."
Mike,"April 2, 2018",Alaska Airlines,5.6,Flew First Class,1.0,0,0,2,0,,,0,No,"We were MVP last year, but came up less than 2000 miles short to qualify this year. We made a reservation last year for March 26 this year, and received an MVP upgrade when we made the reservation. When we checked-in 24 hours before the flight, Alaska revoked our upgrade, and hence our reserved seating, at check-in time. They explained that we don’t qualify for the upgrade this year. They failed to notify us until check-in time, which put us at extreme disadvantage for rebooking our revoked reservation. How can we trust an airline that revokes our confirmed seats at check-in time? And they blamed it on our not achieving MVP last year. They should have notified us of this unfriendly policy in January, or even more customer-friendly, honor the reservation we made while we were qualified to make it. Revoking our upgrade at check-in is the most aggressive punishment, short of dragging us off the plane. We cannot trust reservations on Alaska Airlines. Not even first class. Alaska used to be a fine airline. Something has changed."
Kawaii,"September 3, 2023",All Nippon Airways (Ana),6.6,Flew Business Class,3.0,2,3,1,1,3,2,1,No,"ANA -Business Class Meal – knorr cup of noodle and teacup size vegetable broth Business class flight from Haneda to SF. Got a vegetable soup, more like vegetable broth served in a teacup size cup. Not a single vegetable in that so-called vegetable soup. I can’t taste anything but salt. After 9 hours, I asked for food and the flight attendant said the kitchen is closed with. a smirky smile. I was shocked by ANA’s extremely low customer service performance, from food to the flight attendant’s lack of concern. I wished I had taken pictures of the pathetic food. People in this world have different diet preferences. Most companies in hospitality industry who are customer service- driven are aware of this. So they usually offer more that one type of food. This was the first time I was served without meal options in business class."

I explained that my grandfather is very ill and my cousin in Vienna needs my help with an emergency visa to see him asap. I offered to send his medical records from the emergency room as proof but no, they said there was nothing they could do because I cannot have a layover for more than 24 hours. I was never told that before which is very disappointing. I gave them the option to skip two tickets out of three – they said no again because I need to board all the flights. Then I asked them if I canceled they said I would only get the refund for taxes but they will take my miles which are at least a thousand dollars worth.

It is more expensive than the others but the service had been better than the discount carriers and I had higher expectations. But recently I feel their promise of no fee change or cancellation policy is deceitful. In June I bought a one-way ticket from Hokkaido to Osaka at a time when they were urging customers to ‘buy now and don’t worry if you need to make a change’ policy during the pandemic.  Ten weeks later I wanted to extend my vacation a couple days, but I was told there would be a cancellation fee or I could pay 25,000 yen to push my flight back two days. This really contradicts the promotional message from June. By contrast, other airlines (like United) offered a similar promo but clearly stated that the customer would be responsible if the fare increased for a similar flight. I will never book again using ANA."

I called ANA and told them that I would not be getting on the Nagoya to Tokyo flight since I was already in Tokyo, but I would still be getting on the Tokyo to Seattle flight. They said that unless I pay them 12,500 yen ($120), that I would not be allowed to get on my flight from Tokyo to Seattle. They considered that to be changing the ticket. I didn’t want to change anything. I was simply telling them that I was going to skip one flight but take the other."
Steve,"June 3, 2017",All Nippon Airways (Ana),6.6,Flew Economy,5.0,3,2,3,4,,,4,Yes,"Best airline in Japan is JAL. Second is ANA. Though JAL staffs(pilots/co-pilots/FA) likes to move to ANA as they say, ANA has better benefits for the crews. However, from the user side, JAL has way better service. Such an example for ANA, is that the ground attendants can be swopped with a robot and no one can tell the different. It just means that they’re not trained well and everything is completely by manual. If a customer is complaining, they just go by manual, if they’re mad they just go by manual and customer satisfaction is second to nothing. JAL on the other hand is trained very well and knows how to cherish customers and of course they’ve a smile. Everything up to here is when leaving Japan to USA. From the US to JPN, it all will depend on the staff on duty. But here also, JAL staffs are significantly better trained compared to ANA. A friend of mine boarding together going to SIN had a bad experience and has written the complaint card. After submission in flight to the FA, a senior FA-like person and asked my friend of what’s wrong? FAs didn’t read and has just poured more oil on fire. We understood   that ANA doesn’t train the crews. Its still the same after 10 years."

About midway during the flight, I started  feeling ill and began having cold sweats. I got up to go to the bathroom but when i got there, I passed out and collapsed, hitting my head. When I came out of it, there were 4 flight attendants around me to lend a helping hand. They did an amazing job taking care of me and making sure I was alright. They got me a pillow and blanket, a bottle of water and an ice pack for my head and stood by my side for quite a bit of time. I would like to commend them for their great reaction time and their genuine caring actions they took to make sure I was alright. I did not get any of their names unfortunately, but hopefully somehow they can get recognized for their exceptional service. I greatly appreciated everything they did for me."

Lounge access was exceptional.  Service is good/almost excellent.  Pluses I don’t see from other airline:  They place a basket full of tissues, facial wipes, toothbrush/toothpaste and mouthwash in the bathroom – just in case you need them. Not so good stuff included the Japanese food (some morsels were too dry) and the quantity is not as generous as other airlines would provide."

Zero customer service. 200 Dollars compensation inadequate. Very disappointed. I attempted to use Allegiance once before about a year ago when a trip to Nashville was cancelled during Easter.

Michael,"July 18, 2023",Allegiant Air,3.3,Flew Economy Class,9.0,3,3,5,1,5,5,4,Yes,"Recently flew Allegiant Air from Los Angeles to Grand Rapids. First and foremost, I felt totally safe. The plane was modern and the staff and crew very professional. The pilot gave us a rundown on what to expect (as far as turbulence . . . and he was pretty much right on). I appreciated the advanced notice. The entire staff were friendly, helpful and professional. On time departure. I checked a bag and it arrived with no problems.  The airfare we paid was definitely not “ultra low” (granted we booked it within a few days  before departure) and we still had to pay for all the “extra stuff”. Bottom line however, we needed to get to Grand Rapids to join friends on our vacation after postponing our trip a day. Thankfully the day we needed to get to Grand Rapids, Allegiant operated the flight direct and that was very helpful. Allegiant is a really good choice especially if you need to get to a “less busy airport”, however it does require some planning ahead. The airline played a vital role in allowing us to have a good vacation and got us there efficiently and safely. Much appreciated!"
Daniel,"April 18, 2023",Allegiant Air,3.3,Flew Premium Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,0,5,5,5,Yes,"Our first flight with Allegiant was a pleasant surprise. The Allegiant staff (airport and air crew) were proficient, professional and exhibited care for passengers throughout the flights. I tempered my expectations based on the term “discount airline” and I firmly state that Allegiant exceeded my expectations.  The aircraft were excellent condition, clean with comfortable seats. I was actually happy  that the seats did not recline given all the crazy stories about passenger brawls. We paid extra for bags, legroom and priority boarding. We had no negative surprises at check in, the staff in Sanford FL were busy yet remained positive and took time to answer questions. The staff in Bangor were outstanding with welcome advice for future travel with Allegiant. I cannot disagree with the negative reviews since I wasn’t there however, I will remind travelers to do a bit of research to understand what you are buying. After flying for over 40 years I can say that I have paid far more for terrible travel experiences. I am now looking to see where else I can travel with this airline. Great job Allegiant!"

Since it was a full flight, all the compartments around us were full. The flight attendants stated there were open compartments towards the middle of the aircraft. The passengers were boarding the plane at the time, and I told the flight attendant I was overweight with bad knees, and I did not want to cause a hold-up nor inconvenience any other passengers.

I hope others read this and are aware that after being on hold for almost an hour Allegiant doesn’t care about health and safety, only money."
Aaron,"January 3, 2020",Allegiant Air,3.3,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,3,5,0,5,5,5,Yes,"I feel i have to post this review as so many people have posted negative ones based on absolutely nothing other than expecting a first class flight for a basic economy price.  I have flown allegiant at least 10 times in the last year and a half from des moines to multiple locations in Florida and to Phoenix-Mesa.  I have absolutely no complaints with any aspect of the entire experience any single time. The people on this site that are complaining obviously don’t understand flight delays or more likely can’t afford and don’t fly many places and expect the world for s $200 round trip ticket not understanding that its a budget airline and they wouldn’t have that opportunity if allegiant didn’t exist.  Anyways as one of those people who couldn’t otherwise afford to fly nonstop to some of the best destinations in this country, THANK YOU ALLEGIANT FOR YOUR SERVICE!!!"
Robin,"November 19, 2019",Allegiant Air,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Prefer Zero rating! First and last time I’ll use this airlines. I booked a flight to see my sister and got the flu the day before my flight was scheduled to depart. I canceled and lost the entire fee! I called the airlines and it took 25 minutes for them to answer only to say yes you forfeited the money. But, since you are sick you can submit a doctors note on legal letterhead for consideration. I’m 60 years old and I know when I’ve been given the runaround. Lesson learned. Plus anything extra like a seat, a bag, anything will cost you. Don’t even bother."

Flight 558 out of Rockford IL to Mesa, AZ. Delayed until 10:30PM. Boarding it was delayed until 11PM. Reason: took longer to deplane the arriving passengers. Once on board they revved up the engines, then Captain  announced there is a maintenance issue and they deplaned all of us. Still waiting in the airport to find out if we’re even leaving. No departure time available yet.  I will never fly them again."
Dennis,"January 2, 2017",Amaszonas,3.4,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,0,,,1,No,Worst airline ever. Should not be allowed to fly. Completely ruined our vacation with their unnecessary cancellations and delays. Cost us days of time and hundreds of dollars extra to re9ach our destination. Than they have the dignity to tell us they wont refund our money. After a great deal of arguing and getting upset with countless people they agreed to but it would take 90 days. I have no faith that they will keep their word. DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE.

Bad experience on check-in: booked with credit card, which was electronic use only. Was accepted through the booking process. Brought to check-in counter (you have to show the card again). Because if was not embossed (i.e., no raised number), they couldn’t process it, and I had to buy a ticket again! Then, the flight was severely delayed, and finally carried out hastily.."

Then they booked another flight for the next day at 11.15am without even asking for our permission. It was not even a priority flight for the delay. Because of our tide schedule this was not an option for us. The airport service did not react to our request to get our money back for the cancelled flight and told us to go to our travel agency instead. Now the company charges us a full ticket!!! We lost our money, we lost our ticket, we lost the jungle tour and still had to pay the airport fee, the taxi and a night of extra accommodation. We advice all tourists flying to Rurrenabaque to take TAM instead!!"

Even at first class the service, the check in, the cabins are poor. Why can’t US Airlines have the same quality as Airlines in the East? Are people simply cargo ? Is it because because there is a really low standard?"

My dopp kit was open and  bathroom items were scattered! The key fob to my car was gone! $347 to replace and program it. They offer $80! No flexibility. Horrible experience with their customer “service” people. If you go with AA, pray that your bags don’t get the baggage searcher that ours did. If you lose anything plan on covering at least 75% for replacement. Or, if the customer “service” is too much and just makes you give up, 100% to replace."

When we FINALLY boarded on day 2, we sat on the tarmack for 30 min because there were 28 passengers and should have only been 27. ADDITION, we are talking basic ADDITION of 28 passengers on the manifest. Ridiculous. But after arriving and being told “don’t worry all flights are being delayed so you will be ok.” Gate E8 take a shuttle to gate A8 run to gate 20 plane still their door closed. Go to gate A 25 they can help you. No you need to go to B14 to reschedule for the 11:08 London to Barcelona flight.

Margaret,"April 1, 2023",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Avoid if at all possible. They changed our itinerary and gave us each 3 boarding passes but with flight information on only one of the boarding passes. When we tried to board our second flight, we were told we had no tickets. American claimed that they did not have our tickets. They belong to “One World”, which means they can book flights with multiple carriers and deny any responsibility for problems."
Monica,"April 1, 2023",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,3,3,3,1,No,I got the worse experience ever. I talked to a supervisor and American Airlines supervisor treated me like a piece of garbage from the beginning of the conversation. A few friends told me not to choose American Airlines but I did not know it was that bad. My advise is you better choose another option for your own good.
Frankie,"March 19, 2023",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,Yes,"I fly at least twice a year using American. The pleasantry of their employees and excellent customer service begins when you enter the Airport. From the check in staff at the front desk until you exit your last flight and leave the airport. I am always treated special. Military on the plane get moved to First Class when available. One passenger just had boots on. The attendant asked him if he was military. He said, “Yes” and she moved him to first class. Now that is an eye for detail. They also give Military in Coach first class meals, etc. WE non military are also treated very well. The hospitaarlity on every flight I have had has always pleased me greatly. i learned recently that every Flight Attendant is rated Medic Classification and spends a week every year taking refresher courses. Also courses they are required to complete online. No other airline does this. If you take sick or injured while on the plane they know what to do."
Onika,"March 4, 2023",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,2,3,2,1,2,2,No,This airline messed up all of our flights back. The pilots were nice and flight attendants but the people at the front desk in all spots weren’t nice. they weren’t nice to us at all when you are flying with a massive group they got upset with us because there were so many of us. I don’t recommend flying with an American airline it was so much stress and you don’t need that when your trying to enjoy a trip and then having to deal with rude people.
Michael,"March 4, 2023",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"I had to book an emergency flight due to the death of my father.  It happened to be Super Bowl weekend and I was traveling to Arizona where the Super Bowl was being held.  My ticket number 0012367156748 booked January 29th 2023.  My ticket was 382.00 oneway.  I applied for a refund for bereavement flight and was turned down.  The reason I was given, and I quote”Our current pricing allows us to offer the lowest available fare anytime a customer books a reservation for any reason.  To continue providing our customers the best fares we don’t have a separate pricing for bereavement fares.”  I tried calling customer service to get an exception considering it was Super Bowl weekend.  It cost me 877.00 round trip from Illinois to Arizona.  That is absurd!  No one answers at customer service for days on end.  I will never fly Amercian Airlines again."
Michele,"December 9, 2022",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,I tried to fly out of GJT yesterday afternoon. I have been flying with my pup for over a decade with no issues until I chose to fly with AA. I was told his carrier was too small and he could not fly with me. That was sad to hear. My eyes teared up and the manager smiled and laughed at me. She took pleasure in my sadness. At what point is it okay to laugh at someone who is clearly sad? The more tears I had the more she smiled.  I was supposed to be gone for over a month.  The manager was gaining energy from my sadness. It was an extremely odd experience. It reminded me of my past; I am a DV survivor and have been diagnosed with severe PTSD. She obviously did not know this. How was she to know that her taking delight in my sadness and getting energy off of it would cause so much pain for me and trigger so many terrible memories?
Andrea,"November 8, 2022",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,2,1,0,4,1,4,No,"The rude woman at the front desk got mad at me because I asked to check in some of my luggage early and I did not know that was against the rules. Because I insisted, she got mad and canceled my flight without telling me. So when I go to check in with all of my family, I get the run around, I get ignored, and they had me all through the airport trying to get to this flight that I was never going to get on. Then they tell me that I missedthe flight because I arrived late. I learn later that I was not late, because my flight actually got delayed and I was actually early. But they did not tell me that because I was no longer on that flight(since she had cancelled me off that flight). I sat and cried out of anger and humiliation and they did not care. That was their way of reprimanding me and I was never informed of what really happened. Inhumane treatment of fellow human beings."
Alan,"November 1, 2022",American Airlines,2.3,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,Yes,"Since we’re back to our normal 50,000 miles or so a year in 2022,  I thought I’d recount our experience on American over the past year.  This report based on a recent trip from Santiago Chile to Denver Colorado.                 Flights were full on all four segments.  All were on time or early and baggage claim was fine,  although MIA is always a bit slower.   Planes were spotless (787s SCL to/from MIA;  737Max MIA to/from DEN),  food really good, service as perfect as can be,  both on the ground and in the air.  Granted we fly up front and have access to the Flagship Lounges but for us at least,  American is fine as usual.   Good to be back in the air frequently after the past couple of years."

Shahabedin,"January 15, 2022",Anadolujet,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,No,"Istanbul-Tehran, 23:15 from SAW airport. I went to the check-in counter at around 20:30. At the check-in counter, I had to wait in the line for more than 1.5 hours. The staff could not speak English effectively. In fact, they pronounced “kg” as “Kee Zhee”. Right there, I realized that the baggage allowance for this flight is 20 Kg. That, of course, was my own fault. My baggage was 7 Kg overweight and I was willing to pay for that. However, that simple process took almost AN HOUR because it was sooo haaaard for them to accept USD instead of YTL/EURO. Onboard, everyone was sitting in the closest possible distance from the next person and meanwhile there was no passenger in almost 1/5 of the plane. There was no room for my hand bag in the compartment above my head. I asked the flight attendant for help; he responded “I cannot do anything because I don’t know whose belongings are occupying the compartment”. Finally, at the time of landing, we hit the ground so hard that everyone jumped up their seat. There was more to write, but I could not write the rest due to 200-word limit on this website."

Donatus,"January 15, 2017",Arik Air,3.4,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Arik Air in recent years has become the worst and most unreliable airplane to fly. This assessment is based on safety, customer satisfaction and overall management. I was thinking their problem is only JFK – Lagos route but it spans to both domestic and all other international routes. The staffs and crew members shows nonchalant attitude to customers as if it was a free ticket because management owes them for six months leading to incessant strikes. The day I arrived Lagos they were on strike and no one talk about the ticket I didn’t use. In fact, JFK-Lagos should be banned because of safety issues they seems have only one airplane that’s overused and have not been reliable due to backup of customers. Flight schedules cannot be maintained anymore. Baggage always missing or they will announce “we are sorry we left some bags”  attached are pictures of customers both women/ children and people in wheelchairs left to lay on floor being bitten by mosquitoes in an unhealthy Lagos environment when all the staffs have vanished for safety from angry customers. It was a horrible situation that I would not recommend anyone to buy Arik air ticket anymore. I mean they should be banned from fly"

Aside the fact that tickets were very expensive, I was warned to take virgin as I regularly do but I chose to be patriotic. Got to the airport and the flight was delayed for close to 3hours, prior to this a friend had warned me not to, the food was piss poor for a Nigerian air line and I wonder why they refuse to publish reviews on lost baggage cos mine was missing for a week and I had to spend money doing shopping.. the entertainment on the plane was broken, literally broken.. the extra leg space room just before premium economy/ business class.. pulled the entertainment from under my seat and it was broken off. Poor airl line, bad service but I can’t complain cos they got me to my destination safely. Glory to God for that."

We arrived Lagos by 1230p in time to finish my appoinments by end of the day. I arrived the airport at 12noon well in time for my 3.30pm flight. We sat ignorantly until 4.30p when our flight was announced delayed for 40mins. At 5.10pm we were told to board the bus shuttling us to the aircraft, where we stood for one hour in the swelting heat until we disembarked in anger. Only the did an Arik official tell us that the flight was cancelled. She promised that the flight had been rescheduled for “8am” the following morning. She also said that “it is Arik policy not to compensate passengers when flights are cancelled”, when we complained that we had nowhere to spend the night. I found a dingy low grade hotel closeby, which I paid for. I arrived the airport at 6am the next morning ready for an “8am” departure as promised. I was told that there was no 8am special flight but the 11am scheduled flight. Once again we waited until 3pm when some passengers shut the exit gate in a near riot. Only then were we assigned an aircraft to Benin. No compensation, poor management and customer abuse. I wont fly."

I intended making some journeys via Arik with some friends to Abuja and Lagos starting next year 2017 for business; but going by these reviews and other reviews I read online, it seems the Airline is going through a lot of problems. And this gives me a great deal to worry about. This message is ‘to whom it may concern’ at Arik as I want to know if  there are any improvements; especially with delays, flight cancellations; loss of properties; ignoring customers at the airports and importantly, rough-handling of customers.

Juliana,"October 6, 2016",Arik Air,3.4,Flew Business,8.0,4,4,4,3,,,3,No,I travel with KLM but tried Arik Air couple of times.  Unfortunately my second experience wasn’t really good as my flight was cancelled due to fuel problems. I was given an alternate flight the next day however i missed one day at work and wasn’t happy. I understand there is a scarcity of jet fuel due to high demand and low supply and we should all understand and cooperate. I however don’t see European and other African airlines suffering through this shortage of fuel. I was reading a news on the website www.arik-air.co.uk and found only Arik Air is experiencing the shortage of fuel and probably because of non-payments towards FAAN taxes. I appreciate that Arik Air is struggling to overcome this scarcity and intending to continue their operations as normal

The flight attendants were the best part of the trip, pleasant, accommodating and professional but that is where the good experience ends. Hours wait to check in at the Johannesburg airport, kiosk check in not available, horrible customer service at the owerri airport after my return flight was changed 24 hours before and I was not notified. I recieved no response when I contacted customer service by email, not even an acknowledgement that the message had been received. Overall a disappointing experience."
Chris,"September 8, 2016",Arik Air,3.4,Flew Business,7.0,4,3,3,2,,,2,Yes,its been 3 years I am using Arik Air and I am quite happy with their services. However my last visit was most pleasant ever since they have improved their on ground and in flights services. Planes are upgraded and more clean and the web www.arik-air.co.uk is more easy to understand. The only problem I had was delay in my domestic flight while in Nigeria but they offered business lounge for waiting at airport which took off the stress of waiting. Well done arik-air
Funmike,"April 4, 2016",Arik Air,3.4,Flew Business,10.0,5,4,4,3,,,5,Yes,"When I reviewed comments about the Arik experience on various forums before I traveled with them on the 4th of March, I was pretty apprehensive and expected to have a terrible experience. However, it turned out that the flight was punctual, the plane was clean, the staff were decent and professional,the food was good and the entertainment was good also.The pilots landed perfectly. I am hoping that my journey back home will be just as pleasant. As a matter of fact I have recommended that my daughter and her family travel Arik. However, the Management of Arik needs to look into all these complaints and make amends; retraining their staff, as well as maintain their planes. The Management has put into the airspace something larger companies cannot and will not do. therefore the Management needs to protect its assets by making sure the company is not run down for any reason  due to human error."

The connection experience was awful even though our ticket reads london –  lagos passengers. On coming back my children bought snacks and drink at duty free to our surprise we were told that they cannot go into the plane with drinks bought from duty free.

I’ve never seen an airport filled with so many workers who had no accountability for their jobs. Of course, I can assume they don’t get paid enough to even be held accountable, but unfortunately manager, “Ketsey”, stayed hidden away in his office while “Jerry” lied to our faces hour after hour. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen and, after 11 hours of promises, I asked for my bags and a refund. Jerry said, no problem, until we got back through passport control and then he told me he misunderstood me. I told him he was as incompetent as his airline and he threatened to hit me (I wish I was making this up), “Stating, if I start punching you I won’t be able to stop). Of course, thankfully, a five minute call to my credit card fixed that and good old Jerry was able to locate my bags after another hour and I was on my merry way back to my hotel."

Great leg room. Comfortable seating. Wide variety of multi lingual entertainment choices. Excellent airline."
suhail,"November 29, 2022",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,3,1,2,No,"This airline needs to be given 1 star only. I just cannot find a single point to be happy with them. It first starts with the utterly useless contact center where most of the time you are kept on hold or you get disconnected. The check-in staff at ICN was one of the worst in terms of customer service. Clearly, they were either unhappy in their job or had racism and did not want to help a foreigner. The staff who appeared with the wheelchair for my wife was clearly having huge issues and muttered constantly as he did what was his job! The lounge was another joke with poor food items and limited facilities. On board, the same saga continued. Regrettably, Asiana is the handling agent for all Star Alliance carriers in ICN so even if you opt to take another airline you will still be subjected to these handling agents."
Kailash,"August 16, 2019",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,3,2,3,1,3,3,No,"Terrible experience with Asiana Airlines. Flew back from Incheon (Korea) to Tokyo (Narita). Flight No. OZ108 (Dept. time: 19:05), July 05, 2019. Bought 2 duty free items in the plane. At arrival, forgot the package on my seat. 2 of my colleagues also travelling with me, sitting on last seats also confirmed they saw the package on the seat without knowing that it belonged to me and no other passengers behind them. I realized about missing package after reaching at parking lot of airport, went back to airport but was told that the Asiana airlines counter and phone line are already closed as it was already around 10:00PM. Phoned Asiana Airlines customer service first thing in the morning and was told that they did not find any package on the seat! I phoned them 2-3 times to emphasize that package cannot go anywhere else than lying on the seat and it was also confirmed by my colleagues that no other passenger took it as they were the last ones to get off the plane and they clearly saw the package on the seat. It was clearly taken by either one of the crew members or the cleaning staff. REALLY DISSAPOINTING"
Nicholas,"January 15, 2019",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,1,3,,,3,No,"Hi, I have flown your airline before and was very satisfied but, that all changed on my last flight. My wife and I received an email on the 16th of December saying that our flight new departure time was an hour later, so naturally an hour later we arrived at the airport. When we arrived the counter check-in staff was extremely blunt and rude saying you won’t make your connection now because of the delayed flight which was not our fault even if we arrived earlier flight was still delayed. They then said our only option was to switch to a flight on a different airline to Taiwan with a long layover. This was not convenient as my mother who is almost 70 years old was picking us up in Chicago. I then asked if their were other flights with less layover he said no you take this now or you come back tomorrow. The next nightmare was without any help we were passed to a flight on EVA air which was already boarding. Neither the asiana staff or the Eva air staff offered us any help to get to the boarding gate faster. So we then we’re panicking because we thought we might miss this flight as we wait in the very long security line at Hong Kong airport. After, we make it through security the flight was scheduled to take off in ten minutes so my wife and I with our luggage had to run across the very large airport take the train all in fear of our vacation being ruined even more. We barely make it as they’re closing the cabin door. Next, we fly to Taiwan and I inform my elderly mother we will be later. She said the ride she had aquired to pick us up needs 48 hours notice to change times so she will stay alone at the Chicago airport later into the night to wait for us. The added stress has caused her to become ill and hasn’t been able to enjoy her son visiting for Christmas. I really loved Asiana the first time I flew with your airlines now after this experience I am dreading my flight back to Hong Kong and will tell my friends and family to avoid your airline at all costs. I can’t say how disappointed I am. There reply was terrible it was a copy of the flight guide and a I hope you understand. No customer service is still the problem. They don’t get it was the problem at the beginning causing us to have a near panic attack and afterwards still no better. The check in desk could’ve helped assure us we would make it instead of passing us to another airline that flight was boarding when we haven’t even had our boarding passes printed yet. They don’t care if their customer is happy or enjoy their flight."
Rebecca,"November 6, 2018",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,3,3,3,,,3,No,"I would not recommend this airline for connecting from domestic to international flights for the reason that you have to do additional work exciting custom, pick up your luggage and rechecking it in onto your connecting airline and going back to the custom to get to your gate. Previous experience from other airlines takes care of my luggage all the way to the final destination. If you have 2 hours or less to spare on your layover, or you just do not want to go through the hassle of taking care of your own check-in during the whole flight, this would definitely not be the airline. If you call customer service this is what they would also tell you. Already booked my flight on Priceline so its too late for me. Leaving Cleveland to Chicago to south Korea to Manila I use United Airline then Asiana. I called United customer service representative since they are the first company and they said they’d take care of everything. Flight back from Manila to south Korea to Chicago to Cleveland. I called Asiana and they said I have to pick my luggage up from Chicago and recheck it in on flight to Cleveland. If I only knew I would not take Asiana for my international connecting flights again."
Siegfried,"January 5, 2018",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,3,1,1,,,2,No,"On a Flight from Taipei to Astana via Seoul, the staff of Asiana Airlines told my wife that they were unable to book her luggage to Astana, and that she therefore had to collect it in Seoul and check it back in. The luggage tag also indicated that the bag would travel to Seoul but not to Astana. In Seoul, however, the luggage was not to be found on the luggage belt. Apparently, it was checked in to the plane to Astana after all, but the airline did not inform her of this change. Because of this, she missed her connection. Instead of helping her out, the Airline staff simply treated this as a “now show”, which means that she is not only delayed for four days, but we will end up paying more than 400 USD extra for the trip. Will definitely never consider flying Asiana Airlines again."
Michelle,"April 14, 2017",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"I would like to say my deepest and sincerest thank you to Ms JL Choi, the flight attendant from Incheon to Los Angeles, Flight OZ204 on03/31/2017. Halfway thru the flight I was feeling nauseous, and dizzy. It felt as if my blood pressure is going downhill. I rang for help and Ms Choi was so sincere and courteous, made sure I was comfortable and checked on me throughout the whole flight. I’m glad I flew with Asiana airlines and will be fying with them from now on. Again thank you so much."
khendrue,"October 6, 2016",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy,9.0,5,5,5,4,,,4,Yes,"I few with Asiana Airlines Oz172 from Jakarta to Seoul and the journey was flawless. From the smooth check-in to the boarding and the delightful journey. The food was delicious and the cabin crew were extremely friendly.The flight arrived in Seoul on-time and the disembarkation process was smooth as well. The only improvement Asiana can make is with their entertainment system. Other than that, flying with Asiana was totally worth it"
morgan,"October 2, 2016",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,5,4,,,5,Yes,"Flown Asiana many times. I refuse to fly any of the sub-standard American based airlines. I hope that Asiana never changes, I hope they do not follow the US model of only caring about profits. Stewardesses are fantastic, friendly, helpful and lovely. Pilots and desk staff are very professional. The food is outstanding, restaurant quality even. They make my incredibly long flight from Chicago to Incheon to Saigon almost enjoyable. I will continue to use their services, and Incheon airport is a pleasure."
Lucy Clare,"February 3, 2016",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy,7.0,3,4,3,4,,,5,Yes,"This is my first long haul flight, from London to Manila. I traveled with my husband and infant daughter. All I can say my experienced to this airline is lovely. Except to the flight attendant. I just got a weird experienced to them. Maybe because some of them can’t speak english. Most of the passenger at that time is Korean, so they speak to their language. Some of my request are not being dealt properly, but it’s not a major thing so no problem, that I still enjoy my flight with them."

Bianca,"October 9, 2015",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy,3.0,2,2,3,2,,,3,No,"My flights with Asiana Airlines were very disappointing. Flight from LHR – ICN and return were on the old 777 with small TV screens. Return flight was day flight but the whole plane had the window shades down for the duration of the flight until landing therefore it really felt like a flying coffin and landing in the UK at 7pm after 11 hours of darkness was terrible. My seat was very narrow (it was smaller than the seat next to mine) and when the person in front put their seat down, there was not room at all. The crew do not walk with drinks often and we had to walk to the back of the plane just to get some water.  This is no problem for us but we received much better service on other airlines. Their wine portions are minuscule and when we wanted a ‘second’ glass with our dinner the second portion was even smaller. Nice touch was receiving slippers. Toothbrushes were replenished in the toilets. Their customer service in ICN is very confusing and they are passing you from pillar to post, at the end resolving nothing. I will not be using Asiana for my flights again as there are better airlines to Asia offering much better service and leg room."
jae y,"September 9, 2015",Asiana Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,1,No,"I missed my flight from Inchun to Hong Kong despite arriving there almost 2 hours in advance due to kiosk not being able to find me on the passenger list. Because i wasn’t going to check in any bags, i figured approx 2 hours wud be sufficient, but it wasn’t as it was during a week long holiday–and ended up missing my flight and all my connecting flights to the U.S. via American Air.  As I was in dire need to catch the flight from HK to the US, and there weren’t any other Asiana flights from Inchun to HK that day, I had to spend $500 on a different airline to get to HK on time. considering it was the Asiana’s kiosk issue, I was hoping Asiana would at least partially reimburse $500. but they assumed ZERO responsibility. what exacerbated my anger was that they said i had no proof of my being at the airport at a certain time. so I found the airport bus driver–who remembered me–to testify that i was dropped off at a certain time, but they completely dismissed that evidence. i got no sympathy, no apologyï¿½.just callous jerks who joined forces to defend relentlessly to avoid all responsibility. With all the pending law suits, one would think they try to compensate for plummeting publicity"

Business Class seat was on par with late 1970’s style, effectively almost upright.  Food was of similar style.  Cabins reflect the age of the aircraft and are tired.

Virag,"March 4, 2023",Austrian Airlines,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,No,"❗️Highly not recommend them. They lost our package, told us that they pay for everything we have to buy. Then 4 months later (their policy says that they have 60 days, maximum 3 months) told us that they only paying the half of it. They ruined many of our vacation days, including the day when we spend 8 hours to find everything that we need (hygiene, clothes, and it has to be cheap because we did not have that much money) and a day when they find our luggage and we spend half of the day in the airport trying to get it back, spendig more money on bus tickets to the airport. Extra fun fact: their system was bad, so we couldn’t add the baggage as we did on the way there, so I had to go home with flixbus separated from my partner but at least I know that my baggage is safe. We could complain or sue because their service agent gave us false information and they react on our complain over 3 months, but we know that they would offer us some coupon but we’re never going to flight with Austrian ever again."
Devynn,"November 14, 2022",Austrian Airlines,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,No,I would give them zero stars if possible. They’ve lost my luggage twice. It’s been over four months and they haven’t reimbursed me and won’t reimburse me the amount they owe. They claim they never received my claim even though I’ve submitted it four times. Now I specifically got a carry on luggage so I wouldn’t have to EVER check my luggage in with them again. I was fine on the flight to but on the flight from they would not let me carry my luggage on. I got the carry on luggage from them also. They don’t care about their customers. Don’t ever fly them. Two out of the three times I’ve flown with them they lost my luggage.

I went to wash my hands in the lavatory, and upon returning to my seat the flight attendant reprimanded me publicly for not flushing the toilet.  As I tried to explain to him that I did not use the toilet, just washed my hand there, he challenged me about tissues in the toilet bowl and more. He would not back off and just perpetuated his baseless claim and walked off shaming me to all on board.  It was utterly unprofessional and disrespectful as opposed to the poise and tact expected by airline crew members!"
Brian,"July 27, 2020",Austrian Airlines,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"A warning to those who purchase seat assignments from Austrian Airlines. They may not be honored. We purchased basic economy class tickets through our online agent. We also paid US$160 for advance seat assignments through the agent. Due to COVID travel restrictions, we had to rebook for a later late. Our agent informed us that we would need to repurchase advance seat assignments for the rebooked flight. What happened to our original purchase? No explanation from Austrian Airlines. We purchased seat assignments directly from the airlines this time. There was a minor schedule change (no more than 10 minutes) that resulted in our seat assignments being erased. We were able to get a seat assignment on the inbound flight, but nothing on the outbound. What happened? Absolutely no information from Austrian Airlines other than to contact our agent. Total brick wall despite several requests for information. Won’t be flying these folks again."

My family and I bought return tickets (Chisinau-Vienna) 2 months before the trip. At boarding we were told that the company sold more tickets than places on the plane so we didn’t get seats on the plane. Why is there a possibility when a person buys rather expensive ticket (€314 per return ticket) that person has a chance of not getting on the flight he/she paid for? The person at boarding was very rude to us, raising the tone and couldn’t explain the problem properly, continuously saying “It is not my problem”, which seemed very unprofessional to be said by a representant of the company. My family and I will never use the services of Austrian Airlines again."

Austrian issued a new ticket automatically, and booked a flight through Moscow Domodedovo. The direct option was expensive and I was willing to pay the price to have the convenience of having a direct flight to my destination. The flight Vienna-Domodedovo-Krasnodar is much cheaper, but Austrian would not issue any compensation for price difference. Dealing with reservation help desk was not a pleasant experience either. To get a call through, waiting time was on between 16 and 22 minutes based on 4 attempts made). Staff was not helpful. I had re-booked my direct flight on a date 5 days after my originally planned departure. Again, no compensation for the time lost. Upon checking the price on the website, the price of the new ticket on the website was cheaper than the one I had paid. Again, I was told no compensation will be provided. Dissatisfied with Austrian Airlines. Poor customer service and terrible support. If you want your trip to go smoothly, choose other airline! Don’t book with Austrian Airline! Terrible!"

The staff are RUDE and they make you feel like you should not be asking them  anything (even though it’s their job). I had stewardesses make rude comments about me in German (they did not know that I also speak German) and roll their eyes at me when I asked for water. Last time, Austrian Airlines lost our stroller and instead of apologizing and resolving the issue, the customer service was HORRIBLE, the staff was super disrespectful and it was all in all a TERRIBLE experience. The bathrooms on the plane was disgusting and both my mother and I got food poisoning from the plane. I could go on and on but all you need to know is that: the rudeness of the staff, combined with the fact that the food on the flight is bad and the seats are super uncomfortable make this airline my last choice – and I fly quite often and have quite extensive experience with other airlines, so that means a lot."

Jenny,"July 28, 2022",Avelo,5.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,No,"This was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. Avelo cancelled our flight from Eugene, OR to Burbank, CA (after flying with them up to Eugene the previous week) without any type of heads up. We found out when we got to the airport. They said the next flight out would be two days later, which was very frustrating because we all have lives and jobs to get to, and not everyone can wait around an extra two days. We ended up spending an extra $500 for last minute tickets from Portland to Burbank via Southwest Airlines (which was a much better experience!!), not to mention the extra $100 it cost to get a shuttle from Eugene to Portland (2 hours away). I have yet to get a refund from Avelo for this flight, and customer service is seemingly impossible to reach. Needless to say, I will never fly with Avelo again. Avelo also claims to have lower prices, but once all the fees and additional costs are added, you really aren’t saving much money."

The whole family was already waiting for them and it was impossible for them to wait 3 days. I can’t understand why if their seats were already confirmed why they couldn’t do the simple name change? We lost that money and Avianca won’t refund anything or at least offer a voucher for future travel. They had to buy a whole new ticket with another company and we did enjoy our vacation but not thanks to Avianca."
Pete,"May 31, 2023",Avianca,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Stay away from this airline. Seats suck. No leg room and the charge way to much to upgrade. Baggage policy is the worst too.

Then they charge US$3 for water!!! They charge Literally for everything including coffee and peanuts on international intercontinental 6 hrs flights!!! For the record this flight was US$1200. I had to buy water, when I wanted to pay with my Master credit card that has only chip (no blink option) flight attendants said how my card doesn’t work. Then I tried to pay with my AMEX but the flight attendants told me that they don’t accept AMEX.Two flight attendants wanted a bottle of water back. And then one of the passengers offer to pay for me with her credit card – and I gave her cash. No screens in the seats. You can access Entertainment on your phone via wi-fi (very poor selection of the movies) but then if you want to watch something Avianca is asking you to purchase it for 45€. There is also no option for the flight info."

After a 10 hour flight we stopped for three hours in Bogota, the flight continued to Lima for an extra 3 hours and the flight attendants were so abusive to refuse giving a glass of water on a 3 hour international flight and wanted to charge $3 for a small bottle!!! There was no service, nothing at all provided, no food, snack or beverages and even wanted to charge us!!! We payed $1250 on a flight that typical cost $700. WORST experience of customer service, not providing at least water during a long international flight is way abusive and probably even illegal!!!"

Ceci,"December 8, 2022",Avianca,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,1,0,0,,,0,No,"THE WORST AIRLINE FROM THE US TO LATIN AMERICA, I made a mistake with a reservation and when tried to chance the date I had to fill forms, send emails with my ID pictures, deal with their hideous accents with they pretend to speak English. Their website is complex, they have  no clue when you ask questions. They will tell you things like “at your own risk” or “it is not our responsibility” . I had to fill a form when their site game a system error? They treated me as if it was my fault. hey never wanted to reimburse my money like any other airline in the world would do. They have invented some absurd gift card in which is your money so you are forced to  use their services. it’s a nightmare. They make you pay check in at the airport and very proudly will tell you they do not provide accessibility services for the elderly or anything like that. To make a payment with the UATP you have to change your screen to “Colombian” everything is in Spanish and Colombian Pesos, NEVER AGAIN, AVIANCA THE WORST AIRLINE I’ve taken in 30 years traveling."
Hendrick,"December 1, 2022",Avianca,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"The worst airline I have EVER tested. Their greed bleeds through to every aspect of their disgusting business ethics.

Long story short, this is a horrible airline to work with if you have a family emergency and need to make quick adjustments. I understand you can put things in writing where people purchasing economy airfare relinquish their ability to reschedule their flight without fees, but you’d think that a $422 one-way 6-hour flight pre-purchased 1.5 months ahead of time, made by someone who’s flown with you before, who has had a family emergency where their father had a heart attack and is undergoing life-saving surgery, you would morally think charging them $962 dollars in penalties to reschedule their flight to same day is a little heartless and unethical."

I had to pay for the luggage in pounds because it wouldn’t go to U$S. No customer service, just an automated whapps. Check in at the airport not helpful and slow The food are sandwiches and they ask you to fill a survey about the food?? Entertainment regular. It would be OK for a very cheap price The sits are comfortable."
Kathleen,"January 4, 2022",Avianca,3.9,Flew First Class,1.0,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,No,"I paid to upgrade my seat to first class; My seat was old, uncomfortable, broken& kicked from the person behind me. I was never able to see the status of my upgrade or cancel the request. I was notified the day before my flight that I was charged the $250 to upgrade – even though when I spoke to representatives and looked online prior to this, I was told my reservation couldn’t be found. My return flight didnt have inflight entertainment (4 hour flight). The food was nothing but a gluten filled box: pretzels, cookie and some type of meat (did not look cooked) and cheese in a croissant. I am allergic to gluten and was unable to eat. The fact that they also don’t serve alcohol makes you wonder why anyone would fly with this airline, let alone pay to upgrade for an experience such as this."
Kokan,"April 10, 2022",Avianca Ecuador,4.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,3,4,0,,1,1,No,"The worst airline I have ever traveled with. They will try to rip you off anyway they can. They asked for additional 150 USD per person on the check-in counter, just because we are not Ecuadorian. This was never stated on the app where I purchased my ticket. It is apparently stated in a very small boxif when you buy a ticket their website. The check-in lady even refused to give our passports back until we pay the 150 USD fee."
HOLLY,"December 15, 2019",Avianca Ecuador,4.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,4,1,4,1,3,4,No,"On November 20th,2019 I traveled on AV FLT #456 from Quito, Ecuador through El Salvador FLT#522 to LAX.I have a few concerns. On FLT#522, a five hour flight, the passengers placed their used toilet paper in piles around the toilet. If passengers can not read Spanish/English the flight crew should make an announcement that toilet paper can be placed in the toilet. Secondly, in preparation for landing, seats were not required to be in an upright position nor were tray tables or belongings stored away. When I retrieved my bag in LAX it was wrapped in plastic. When I went to unwrap the bag at the Southwest counter it was soaked through with what felt like HYDRAULIC FLUID or lubricant. I took pictures and called Avianca to file a report immediately. I later filed Avianca’s form and attached pictures, clearly, documenting the damage to the bag and contents. Today, 12/14/2019, I receive an email from Avianca. Basically, when your bags are in their care they are not going to take responsibility for damage done to them. I have flown all over the world and never encountered such lax safety standards and unethical behavior. Be safe and fly another airline."

I booked 3 international flights and made one letter mistake on one name for a child. I have tried for 3 weeks and over 20 phone calls to attempt to fix it. Avior outright refuses to! They only offered to refund the one ticket, effectively separating a mother and child for an international flight. The home country will not allow this and I stand to lose over $2000 in airfare due to the Avior airlines complete incompetency. I speak Spanish fluently, and even sent my sister in law to their office in Maracay, Venezuela to attempt to reach a solution…..and crickets. Avior airlines are swindlers. They are crooks. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY."

Due to a 7-hour flight delay to Baku, we missed our next flight from Baku to London.

Larisa,"October 4, 2016",Azal Azerbaijan Airlines,5.0,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,4,4,,,5,Yes,"This was the first time I flew with Azerbaijan air transcontinental and I was truly impressed by the number of things. First of all since I’m a big girl it’s always an issue with width and distance between seats, this airline is far better in organizing their seating areas than Ukraine or Russian airlines with whom I flew in the past. The staff is very polite and professional. Bathrooms were really clean which is surprising since its a 8 hr flight. They fed us few times including snacks and it was delicious! The airport in Baku was gleaming with cleanliness. The only issue I had was the wheel chair transportation: I had to ask the airport personal in Baku a few times to get me someone to wheel me to the transfer gate and still the fellow passengers helped me before the rep came to get me. Over all I’m happy with this airline and will be their customer along with all of my large family on both continents. Thank you guys."
Wafa,"July 14, 2016",Azal Azerbaijan Airlines,5.0,Flew Economy,1.0,3,1,1,1,,,1,No,I had a flight from Baku to Dubai on the 9th of July and I was wearing a white jeans. Upon arrival to Dubai an Arabic lady approached to me informing me that my trousers is dirty on the back (red stain) to which I was surprised and ran to the washroom to check. It was a red stain which I got from the chair in the aircraft A340 where the chairs were red. It was the most embarrassing moment in my life as I could feel the look of people at me. Staying in such condition at the airport for 1.5 hrs till I got through passport control and took my luggage I couldn’t lift my eyes as I felt so shy. As soon as I reached home I called Azerbaijan airlines to speak to the manager but he was. It available and I was advised to sent my complaint by email which i did. And yesterday I received a email from them informing me that they investigated the condition of chairs and the whole aircraft and that there was no problem with their aircraft. So basically they blamed me being a liar and not even a simple apology received from their side. I would not recommend to anyone to fly with Azerbaijan airlines after the embarrassment I went through. They have worst customer service.
Mehmet,"February 17, 2016",Azal Azerbaijan Airlines,5.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,1,,,1,No,I came from Tbilisi to Baku on 16.02.2016 and my flight delayed about 4 hour 20 minutes. There was no cleare explanation about the delay and when i asked the authorized person in azerbaijan airlines office they told me that they did not know why there is a delay. They did not offer any food or drink during the long wait (4h20m) which is against the law of EU and many other air law. And finally when they took us to plane i just ask for a coffe and they told me that i need to pay for coffe. After i arrive to Baku Airport i looked for customer services to make a complaint and he told me that do whatever you want i do not care. That was an awful experience and i will spread this as much as i can in social media and many review sites so others won’t have same problems.

I almost thought I was going to miss the connecting flight! I didn’t have my passport with me for such a long time that I thought they are plotting something against me or may be kidnap me! The atmosphere at the airport was very dodgy and I spend several minutes feeling very insecure. They speak very poor English, have very primitive mannerism and do not know some simple basic rules of a civilised society. I am sorry to be so opinionated but I genuinely believe that they have a long way to go before they can deal with international passengers from developed world effectively."

Check-in was standard, nothing special, else than the blue decoration they put on everything… The airplane was VERY good, perfect seats, very good comfort, and a very comfortable plane! They serve you as much snacks as you want, and as much beverages as you want! One minus would be their hub in Viracopos, which is an old, hopeless airport. Else the prices are a bit high due to it being a “low cost carrier”, but it is worth it, comparing this to other airliners, such as GOL or TAM!"
Remo,"April 2, 2018",Bahamas Air,3.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,4,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I bought a ticket from Havana (Cuba) to Nassau (Bahams). The airline was Bahamasair. Few hours after my purchase I received a confirmation. On the day of flight I went to the airport 4 hours in advanced, because in Cuba everything takes time and Cuban is known for his arbitrariness and laziness. In my confirmation from Bahamasair was written that my flight is going to leave from terminal 1. However, neither was my flight on any destination board nor knew any airport stuff anything about it. After a while I figured out that Bahamasair normally operated from terminal 2. As a result I took a taxi to terminal 2 (don’t forget it’s Cuba and building and maintaining an airport is totally conceptless). Same thing here. Nobody in terminal 2 knew anything about my flight. So I called the airline. The friendly employee from Bahamasair customer service told me that there is no flight on that date. I asked her why it was possible to buy a ticket and why I got a confirmation. She answered that this happened because of a computer error and she had to check how does a refund works. As a result I booked another flight with another company, which left 2 hours after my original Bahamasair flight. While I was waiting on my new flight I saw my old Bahamasair flight taxing to the runway. It turned out that even thought I got confirmation from Bahamasair customer service that there is no flight on this day, there was one. Talking again with Bahamasair to figure out why their customer service was laying to my and when I get my refund, they told me that they normally not operate on that day, but my flight was an exception and because this flight happened a refund is not possible."
Joshua,"February 14, 2016",Bahamas Air,3.8,Flew Economy,5.0,3,2,4,1,,,0,No,Bahamas air really need to work on on time performance. In Fort Lauder dale we waited about 45 minutes before our flight come.
Ashley,"August 17, 2015",Bahamas Air,3.8,Flew Economy,9.0,5,4,5,0,,,3,Yes,"I’ve been flying BahamasAir on a regular basis since childhood and have always had a safe, enjoyable experience.  Flights can be somewhat prone to delay due to tropical weather, but they’re certainly no worse than any American airline.  Due to all the island-hops they do, the pilots are famed for their exceptional takeoff and landing skills, so much so that it’s common for American pilots to do training with the carrier."
Eric,"May 27, 2014",Bahamas Air,3.8,Flew Economy,0.0,2,2,3,0,,,2,No,"If you can afford to be late, then by all means, take this airline. But if you want to be somewhere on time, don’t ever ever ever book with this airline. Let me tell you my nightmare."

Gary,"October 8, 2019",Bamboo Airways,9.0,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,4,5,3,5,5,4,Yes,Bamboo Airways the newest full service airline to commence operations in Vietnam. I travelled from Hanoi to Danang return Business class. Website a little clunky but satisfactory as was web check in. Ground operations were very impressive with a personal escort from business counter through dedicated security and to club lounge. Lounge equally impressive currently shared with Vietjet whilst new lounge under construction.  By far the best domestic lounge experience in Vietnam. Similarly escorted from lounge to gate when boarding commenced..
Thomas,"September 8, 2022",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Business Class,9.0,4,5,5,0,4,5,3,Yes,"There deserve to be called Asia’s favourite boutique airline. Everything about flying Bangkok Airways was a pleasure. From efficient check-in to friendly staff on the ground and in the air. But, most importantly the comfort of the business class seats. They are from an era in aviation when comfort was king. Okay, so there was no in-seat entertainment screen – but who still needs those anyway?"
Ron,"March 24, 2018",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,4,4,0,,,4,Yes,"Chiang Mai – Bangkok flight. I was able to get a seat uptake front of the plane, and as I didn’t have any check in, I went direct to the lounge that Bangkok Airways provides all its passengers — with wifi, newspapers, drinks and snacks, better in my opinion than its major domestic competitor’s business class lounges. It’s a great reason to fly with them. The flight was on an old A320, but was pleasant. The only thing I disliked about the flight was the use of buses to the aircraft in Chiang Mai and from the aircraft in Bangkok, and that seems to happen quite often. Otherwise I would give them 10/10."
Jacques,"May 23, 2017",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"I flew Bangkok Air from Phuket to Bangkok. What a pleasure to fly with them. You are not treated less because you only fly economy class. The cabin crew are well trained, extremely friendly and the entire trip was a pleasure. The service I got on this airline is way better than what I received from a major airline like EMIRATES. Bangkok Air stands out heads above the others.!! Well done Bangkok Air."
Andre,"April 1, 2017",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,8.0,3,4,4,0,,,4,Yes,"Ko samui to Chiang Mai- Very good airline, they can be pricey but their service is supreme! quick check-in, flight on time, on the waiting hall in Samui they offer free snacks in case you didn’t have breakfast! No complaints at all and would fly them again if given the chance!"
Chris,"March 23, 2017",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"I love Bangkok Air, took 2 flights from BKK to Chiang Mai and BKK to Koh Samui. One of the best companies I took.

Ove,"March 3, 2017",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,5,Yes,Bangkok to Chiang Mai onFeb 25. Fantastic one hour flight. I was supprised that were served a full hot meal on such short and also cheap flight.
Graham,"January 20, 2017",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,8.0,4,4,5,3,,,4,Yes,"Use this airline for the BKK-PNH leg, always fly economy as its only 50 mins. generally the airline is on-time. it’s comfortable and reliable."
Dave,"October 9, 2016",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,3,No,Lack of customer service. Asked to speak to a manager and was told they were off that day. Had to refund my ticket (30 day process) and reissue new ticket at airport. Next time I will travel another carrier.
Deborah,"September 22, 2016",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,8.0,5,4,4,1,,,0,Yes,"Positively surprised. For us it was the first time to fly with Bangkok Airways on a domestic flight within Thailand and we were positively surprised. Free wifi in the airport, friendly service and free drinks, as well as free snacks at the airport, which made the waiting time very pleasant."
Pui,"August 30, 2016",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,9.0,3,3,5,0,,,4,Yes,"I am an ex-pat living in Koh Samui and have flown Bangkok Airways dozens of times to many destinations including Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Phuket and Bangkok. I have flown both business (blue ribbon) class as well as economy. I have also at one point qualified for their Premier frequent flyer category for one year which provides access to their Blue Ribbon (business class) Lounge for you and a traveling companion even if you fly economy, as well as separate check-in line.  I have always found this airline to be very friendly and efficient, with superior in-flight service. Considering the short haul of most flights, their meal/snack service is perfectly adequate. It does vary considerably depending on flight though. The ATRs seem to get a small cold meal like a sandwich, whereas the Airbuses get a normal hot meal. The Blue Ribbon Lounge is as good as any business class lounge for other airlines, especially at BKK Airport with multiple massage chairs and private TV lounge areas. Their normal lounge that all passengers are eligible for is also a very nice perk of flying with Bangkok Airways, serving snacks like chicken pastry puffs, small sandwiches, brownies & sticky rice."
Stephen,"July 22, 2016",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,0,,,5,Yes,I have flown with Bangkok Airways on numerous occasions both on A320/319 and ATR’s  and have always found the flight and service to be exemplary. Their frequent flyer program is free to join and the points quickly accumulate and can be taken as free flights. Their free lounges are a god send and are available to all who have a ticket. I have flown with all the other carriers in Thailand and have found Bangkok Airways to be the best by a country mile. I wouldn’t fly with anyone else.
David,"January 30, 2016",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,3.0,2,2,4,0,,,3,No,Rather disappointed with my recent trip with Bangkok airways. Old Airbus planes that are ready to finish service which could clearly be seen by how dirty they were externally. They were very dirty inside also. Marks on seats and tray table. Seat I was sat in was broken and rocked back and forth during the flight. I’m not sure if this is safe as it felt not to be correctly fixed down. I’m just glad I only had to endure sitting on those aircraft for 2 hours. Any longer would have been hell!  This airline also managed to damage my brand new luggage. I will not recommend them and will not use again if its possible to avoid.
KONSTANTIN,"January 8, 2016",Bangkok Airways,7.7,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,5,Yes,Very pleased with my flight from Koh samui to Phuket. Very nice little lounge with complimentary snacks and refreshments. Small meal on a 1 hour flight. safe and friendly service. Many airlines should look up to Bangkok Air . Highly recommend.

This happends so many times with them.The inflight food is a joke,cold chicken pie and cheap orange juice.They take out flights so often and if you get the last flight out of Bangkok,it is nrmally delayed by 2 to 4 hours.If I do not have to use this airline I would not."
Cristina,"August 9, 2023",Batik Air,5.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,No,Left for 48h in Kuala Lumpur after the Batik Air flight was delayed and had to constantly chase them to get put on new flights to reach our destination. Then we find out that for some unknown reason they modified our return flights and did it incorrectly. As a result we were denied boarding on our trip home. We had to purchase new tickets leaving us out of pocket by $8000. Any attempt to contact them was left unanswered. Nobody answers on the phone or the Whatsapp so called Customer Service. No compensation was offered and no reply to our complaint. They should not have a license to operate! Avoid them at all costs.
Sophie,"July 26, 2022",Batik Air,5.9,Flew Economy Class,4.0,3,1,1,0,,,4,No,I have a list of complaints about this airline. But by far the biggest is the rude flight attendants. Both ways.

Padahal ada orang memilih batik air krn IFE walau sedikit lbih mahal drpd maskapai lainnya. Sudah berlangsung beberapa kali dn cm menerima kata maaf saja. – makanan selama flight biasa saja. Roti di piring, dan 2 jnis makanan lainnya. Bisa minta tea stlh makan. – setelan landing keluar lebih awal dr wxonomy class. Tp ambil baggage sndiri.

We are being badly treated by batik air ground crew, they are mocking us. No one speaks enough English to explain to us that there is 2 and half hours of delay. We had to ask another kind passenger to translate for us. The announcements of updates for delay are not given in English and they are being disrespectfull.This is unacceptable from an air line like Batik air. I expected better customer service.Moreover, they are claiming that we cannot be compensated. I don’t think that Halim International Airport should be called “international” when no one out of 6 ground staff can explain a simple delay in English…. unacceptable from such an airline. I will not be using them again!"

I have no complaints about the plane, punctuality, level of service, food. Those aspects were quite OK. However, I do not like the Schonefeld airport. And also the absence of the entertainment in the plane made the flight somewhat less exciting. Otherwise – thank uoi very much “Belavia”!"

On the ground staff don’t pay attention to your visa so anyone without proper docs could board the plane. Flight delayed by 1 hour but fully booked! service basic but crew friendly and caring, plane as old as time, time to update! The security is not taken seriously they didn’t check if people were with seat belts on. Would recommend people to think twice if they have the choice."

Sergio,"February 23, 2021",Binter Canarias,5.5,Flew Economy Class,10.0,3,5,5,4,5,5,5,Yes,"Since the COVID crisis began, I have always been selecting this company, because of the security measures and attention they offer. Apart from how new their Embraers are, they offer free picnics, soft drinks, coffee, free checked bags and they don’t put any problem at all. It is also the only airline that operates between Galicia and the Canary Islands that allowed us to carry an 800 gram Toy Rabbit in a carrier in the cabin. The rest of the companies are prohibited. The distribution of seats is usually done by leaving the seat next to it empty, in this way they try to limit contact with other travelers, and they offer the picnic to take away. They have recently incorporated antiviral systems for the air, so they constantly renew the air with a disinfection system, which is appreciated in these times of pandemic."

This is clearly a scam as over 50 people on our flight were impacted by this. If they want you to include a middle name they need to ask for it when booking. Very unethical practice and according to the supervisor happens every flight!!

The airport staff were sorry for us (people from 6 cancelled flights with this company) and started giving us all the phone numbers they had from them. After calling them at least 6 times and being on hold each time for at least 20 minutes, I got so many mixed information because nobody knew anything!!! After 8h since the flight was cancelled they sent a person from Romania!!! to talk with us! So they had nobody hired in the Luton airport. It was the only airline with nobody to tell us anything. In the end we flew the next day (>24h spent in Luton airport without anywhere to even sit). Some of the luggages that were checked in for the original flight got lost. In the airport we didn’t receive any voucher or anything for food and drinks (all the other companies were giving away those!!!) and the lady that finally came to answer our questions didn’t even know that the flight from Iasi actually landed in the morning!!! We knew more that she did. And she didn’t seem to understand that is not normal not to have anyone to give any information for so many hours and to have to call so many times to get anything (even if it was the wrong information!!!). I also paid for 2 breakfast (they are NOT CHEAP) and never received them."

We have used Tarom and Wizz in the past and never had any problems with them; although Tarom’s aircrafts are really old they are clean. We went for the cheapest one that day”¦ expensive mistake. The aircraft was dirty; we found an empty bottle of water and a chocolate wrap in the front pocket, so obviously the cleaners or the crew didn’t do a very good job. When we arrived in Luton we went through border control straight to the conveyor belt. We collected our hold bags and we were still waiting for the baby’s pushchair. The very last thing to come on the conveyor belt was our pushchair that looked a bit unusual. When I grabbed it I realised it is badly damaged. The aluminium frame had been snapped in two in both sides. I went to show it to the lady on the desk and to fill in the forms. I was incredibly upset as it is a Â£725 Silver-Cross pushchair. The lady at the desk apologised and asked me to fill in a form. She told me that I was going to be compensated within 10 days.

Im,"April 25, 2017",Blue Air,3.8,Flew Premium Economy,3.0,3,3,3,2,,,2,No,"Bluair is the only airline which requires disabled passengers i e wheelchair users to sign a disclaimer letter refusing to accept any responsibility in case harm comes to them during boarding or flight. This is a disgusting practice and should be investigated. Also, 9 times out of 10 they do not respect the rules of boarding children and disabled FIRST onto the airplane which results in chaos, disorganisation and squabbles for seats as most other passengers are already sitting on the plane.  Some staff can be rude and disrespectful towards special needs travellers. The company has to put some serious thought into future training     on this issue."
Katja,"February 28, 2017",Blue Air,3.8,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,5,Yes,Have tried Blue Air for the first time from London to Cyprus  and had been a little suspicious about what to expect. But from check in to landing everything was excellent on this flight! I do have much travel experience with all kind of airlines. Blue Air surprised me in a positive way with their great service for a very good price. Even a free meal was served – which tasted like real food and was better than most I had on other flights. On top they are working with local supply companies from Cyprus which I appreciate. I would strongly recommend this airline!
Andra,"January 24, 2017",Blue Air,3.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,0,,,2,No,"I flew with this company several times, hoping things will get better, but every time things got worst!From a minimum of 2 h delay, the delay increased this time to 2h and 45 min!!!And every time they blame it on the weather, but the other companies do not have this problem and do not have such long delays!! They somehow manage to delay their flights in such a way so you do not have the chance to get a refund or compensation!only frustration and anger!! This will be the last time I will fly with them and I will encourage everyone to choose the other airlines like Wizz Air or Tarom!"
Ionut,"January 20, 2017",Blue Air,3.8,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,0,,,5,Yes,"I usually fly with Blue Air. Blue Air is the best low-cost company I’ve been flying with up to now. I never had any problems with them, you get free drinks and food on board, you can carry-on a 20 kg bag for free on the domestic flights, the ground stuff and cabin crew always polite and helpful, and the pilots rock to every landing they perform. They offer you a lot of free services for low fares, compared to other low-cost companies. It’s true some of the plains are a bit old, but that doesn’t matter as long as the flight is safe. To be really honest, I do recommend Blue Air as an airline to fly around Europe."

Online checkin – can’t modify seat allocated unless you pay (unfortunately I was allocated the last row near the toilets).  No bag drop off at airport so long queues with people who hadn’t checked in on outward flight.    Flight ok, plane not new…..  My main point is about some of the cabin staff’s negative and offhand attitude.  2 in particular who were more interested in their smartphones and talking  to one another than taking care of the passengers.    Neither spoke proficient French or even English properly.  I suppose you get what you pay for….."

At the check in in Malaga we have asked if the buggy is included in the fair and they have told me “yes, of course”. I got a tag for the buggy and traveled ok. Unfortunately on the return flight just 4 days later the have told me I cannot have the buggy and if I want it I will need to pay extra. After long arguments I had to leave the buggy behind and carry my kid. Now I need to buy new one as the price they asked me to travel back with the buggy is ad much as new one cost.  It is so embarrassing what they do … How this was included in part of the trip and not back when the booking was made as return flight …. This is not the first time we face this grumpy ladies from Blue Air with their silly attitude."
Oana,"October 10, 2016",Blue Air,3.8,Flew Economy,6.0,2,4,2,0,,,0,No,"Yesterday, October 9th, when flying from Beauvais to Bucharest, even though I had checked-in online and printed the boarding passes I had a very unpleasant experience. More specifically, after waiting in line your employee gave me a hand writen note with a code and asked me to go to another desk to get some kind of a confirmation and then come back. Mean while, someone had left some unattended luggage and that part of the terminal had been blocked. I’ve asked some other employee (a Romanian lady who had no name tag and refused to tell us her name) for another solution – give a call to check the checkin/print the boarding passes for us/something. I felt deeply frustrated and furious with the lack of humanity, empathy and flexibility. Not only that she didn’t show any empathy with the fact that we might loose the plane (we arrived at the airport 1 hour and a half before the take off), but she also told me that I didn’t complete correctly the form at the online check in, so implied I was to blame for not having the boarding pass."

They are often late and I have been cancelled before as the pilot didn’t turn up. Ill I think. Last time they double allocated my seat and there was a bit of a kerfuffle before I was allowed on even though I had a proper and correct boarding pass. I’m not overly enthusiastic at the geriatric planes they use. No doubt they are cheap to buy.

Very happy that I have this option from the Sunshine Coast."
Michael,"July 4, 2023",Bonza,9.5,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,4,5,5,4,Yes,"I have been flying for over 50 years and found that Bonza has really opened up Australia for decent fair prices, service and overall good service from checkin to baggage on arrival. I took a flight from Newcastle to Proserpine at a cost of $75 Australian dollars. It was a 2 hour and 15 minute flight. the price of the ticket was  two thirds cheaper than Qantas and Virgin Australia. Bonza don’t fly out of Sydney but do from more localised airports like Newcastle. I am impressed. The plane was a Boeing 737 800 and was completely full. All I saw were happy faces, Keep up the great service Bonza, you have won me over."

I was told it would be sent on the next available flight, which would have been July 6th.  It is now July 17th and still no bag.  I have left over 40 messages via text, Messenger and email with no response.  I have no idea where my bag is, if I will get it and if I will be compensated for it if they completely lost it.  I can’t get a hold of anyone.  This is the worst customer service I have ever seen in an airlines.  They have completely ghosted me on all three platforms of communication. There is no direct phone number so I am absolutely helpless.  I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and Department of Transportation."

I’m willing to do most anything for a travel opportunity. I will never fly Breeze again. Multiple postponement on the same flight. Incorrect information send out via text. Lost bag ( 5 days as of now) no communication. They literally have no phone number to call. Ever airports can’t reach them. I e had to drive hours to go find my bags just to find no one at the desk. Absolutely horrible. No amount of savings is worth this .

Any Breeze option was 2 days out and frankly, do not trust that flight will actually happen. No customer support, the app they refer you is very poor and does not offer any solutions. Airline has proved to be extremely unreliable and not worth any savings, as it will end up costing you in the long run.

Or they cancel the flight altogether, which they did for my LAX to Westchester, NY flight four nights in a row. The weather was fine. That was not the issue. In fact, I am a very frequent flyer and know that when I’m saying that I have no idea what their problem is, it means their operations are positively abysmal. Also, on the few flights I successfully took on Breeze, in their ‘first class’ cabin, your first snack is free but if you want a second snack, it’s $9.00. This is all you are given for a six hour flight. So, my Chex Mix bag was included, but when I asked for the M&M’s too, they charged $9. Needles to say, it was an M&M-less flight for me."

I paid for the ‘Nicer’ Ticket which allows for a personal item/carry-on/and checked bag and was seated in their ‘extra legroom’ section at the front of the plane. While our flight was almost 2 hours late on arrival.  There was an electronic issue air bridge at both locations causing additional delays.  After waiting almost an hour we discovered our bags were sent to SNA instead of XNA. As we all proceeded to the gate agent we were asked to write our name and email on a scrap piece of paper.  We woke up to emails with a bag claim number and a phone number we could text for updates.  The website has no customer service number and you can ONLY contact Breeze via email, text, or Facebook Messenger.  I FINALLY received a response. They told me they were aware of the issue and doing their best.  Compensation is considered from non-home airport arrivals and I needed to upload detailed receipts to a link provided.  I am not at my Home Airport and may still have no idea when i’ll receive my bags."
Sean,"January 6, 2023",Breeze Airways,1.1,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,No,"Terrible airline. Deceptive practices. They claim you can cancel your flight “without penalty” but then they will only give you future flight credits. When you purchase tickets, they make it seem as though the flight is non-stop. After you get the tickets, you find out there is a “breezeway”/layover. During that layover, they lost our luggage, which we didn’t get back for 2 days. They offered no compensation. Then, they cancelled our return flight the morning of, forcing us to get tickets through another airline. As a refund, they gave us future flight credit. Why would we ever want to fly with this airline again? The credit is a penalty. It guess it’s ok if you want to be stranded somewhere without your luggage. Of course, the only way to communicate with them is via text, whenever they feel like replying to it. It’s the worst airline I’ve every flown with."

Two days before my flight was scheduled to depart, they emailed me with a notification that my flight had been cancelled. No opportunity for recourse, no phone number on their website, and no response for almost 24 hours to the emails, sms messages, and messenger app messages I sent. Even worse, if and when they do finally respond to you, it turns out that they won’t even help you rebook a comparable flight. It’s basically, “Sorry, you’re shit out of luck.”"

In the last 12 weeks, 4 international return flights 3 have been disrupted, 3 cancelled or missed connections as a result of delays. The last of which involved 2 cancelled flights, resulting in a night in Gatwick on the way AND the way back. On the return cancellation after sitting on the tarmac for 3hrs, BA refused to facilitate hotel rooms and told the plane load of passengers that everyone was on their own, both in rebooking alternatives, and in finding accommodation. I have never been treated so badly, this at a time when the delay cost me the ability to see my mother before she died. Avoid at all costs if possible."

I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That’s when they advised me that because I had “abandoned” travel with them, they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don’t explain that on their website – they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. When I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I ended up incurring costs of £700 in airfare, hotel, and meals. This airline has definitely gone downhill."
Alison,"August 9, 2023",British Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,Dreadful airline that has got worse over the years. Oversells its seats and has no one to deal with this. Loses baggage. Has no hot drinks nor sandwiches on short flights. Unlikely to ever use again.

Paul,"July 4, 2023",British Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,4,0,,,0,No,"Years ago I swore to never fly British Airways again due to their shocking service, attitude and flight cancellations. I decided to recently give them another go for a flight from Nice to London 11.50am arriving 12.40pm so I could attend a meeting in the afternoon, only to have BA cancel my flight at the last minute because they didn’t fill the plane and putting me on another flight at 8pm than night getting in at 10pm!! What am i meant to do with that! I only have two days in London and my itinerary is tight. So I advise go Eazy Jet or Wiz as they are of the same standard only much cheaper. save your money and don’t fly BA."
Phil,"June 26, 2023",British Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,5,5,4,1,4,5,No,Terrible.  Flew first class.  They canceled my initial flight and had to rebook but their computer system was down for a day and a half.  Their website is not easy to navigate.  Difficult to reach a customer service person on the phone while traveling.    The in-flight meal was superb and the cabin crew superb.  They lost my bag on my flight home from London and never sent me an email to advise the status for 6 days.
Janet,"June 19, 2023",British Airways,4.8,Flew Premium Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,The most horrible airline ever.  Service and hospitality is very poor.  Flights get canceled all the time.  Our flight got canceled in Rome and they left the Passengers by themselves since British Airline does not exist in Rome. We had a nightmare on the way of home. Never ever book with this Airline since you will regret it.
Shayan,"June 12, 2023",British Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,No,"British Airways cancelled our return flight and with less than 48 hours notice, and managed to lose our luggage (eventually found days later) on the return leg we did eventually take. These issues were ridiculous enough, but I believe British Airways still owes us compensation under the Canada Transportation Act, and the customer service experience they’ve provided in pursuing these claims has been another level of insulting."

We lost our flight in LHR to LIN at 7:20a and we were told to wait until 2pm and we got 10 pounds to spend. In Italy my family waited from 10 to 3pm and had to travel between airports LIN to MXP (68.1 km).  2.Lost luggage. We did not have luggage for our entire 7 days tours in Italy. I spent my tours vacation time exchanged several emails with the BA and the delivery company because the receiver address had a typo. 3.Finally, our return flight to DC was delayed almost 1 hour waiting seated the airplane just because the Capitan decided it was an emergency to wait for the family that needed to get their taxes refund to get their luggage from the airplane. I filed a complaint after my trip and we got less of what we spend just in our flight (1),  evoucher for our luggages, $70 coupon and 50 euros on personal items for the 8 days-  our luggages were delivered 5 days after arrived."

No free wifi, and crowded noisy below standard, filthy bathrooms. Old airplanes even the A380 is designed in strange with seats looking to the back of the airplane, with uncomfortable seats. The 777 was somehow better. The ground services is horrible, with no gates numbers showing untill the boarding time, so be ready to run to catch your flight."

Margaret,"April 1, 2023",British Airways,4.8,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,1,Yes,Avoid carrier if at all possible. They belong to “One World”– they will book your flight with multiple carriers and take zero responsibility for anything that goes wrong. American Airlines changed our itinerary and gave us each 3 boarding passes with seat assignments. We tried to board the second flight and are told we didn’t have tickets. American said they didn’t have our tickets and British Airways closed three hours previously. I contacted BA. They claim no fault on their part.

My first flight was through Brussels Airlines and my flight went from Brussels to Manchester. I had a connecting flight from Manchester to JFK and then JFK to Atlanta. In Brussels, I checked my luggage through Brussels Airlines. It was checked through to Atlanta (my final destination), but I was told once I landed at JFK, I was to pick up my bag at baggage claim and place it on a transfer belt in order for it to go onto Atlanta. Once at JFK, I waited and waited, my bag never came. I have spoke with numerous airport representatives and airline representatives and no one can assist me with finding my bag. My bag never made it on my connecting flight in Manchester to JFK, meaning the last time I saw my bag it was in possession of Brussels Airlines. Brussels Airlines refuses to assist me with finding my bag, because according to their system it made it to Manchester.Brussels Airlines is the definition of unprofessional and I am beyond frustrated with how they have handled this situation."

Stacey,"July 4, 2019",Brussels Airlines,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"The plane was old and dirty. So old there was no phone charger or any other amenities. We always sit exit row. We were surprised to be told that we could not have our small bags stowed under the seat. After one flight attendant came by to harass us about that, another came and told me that I could not have my neck pillow. Really? My neck pillow? Nor my hat, I was lucky she let me have my book smh. My partner was also told he could not wear his headphones because we were in the exit row. Absolutely no beverage served. I understand it was a cheap commuter flight, but hell I’ve paid $59 on Southwest on a similar flight duration and was still offered a beverage. This was the most poorly pressurized plane I have ever ridden in. The decent was absolutely painful and torturous."

Zhanna,"December 8, 2018",Brussels Airlines,3.0,Flew Economy Class,8.0,2,4,4,0,,,3,No,"I have terrible experience with Brussels Airlines. They left my luggage in Toronto (where I started my trip). It took me 4 hours in lines @ Geneva airport (2 times, 2 hours every time) just to get information where my luggage is. They didn’t deliver my luggage on-time to Chamonix where my 6-day backpacking hike started, and I had to buy everything again at the last moment. Their web site is buggy, doesn’t have any phone number to Customer Service, and I filled in buggy forms several times on their website without getting any confirmation with case number. I got confirmation just in 8 (!!!) weeks.They didn’t compensate me all my expenses, and all communications with Brussles Airlines are just one-way communication: they will contact you or they will not, no clue why and when.Nobody is going to compensate your time, nobody is going to compensate all yuor inconveniences during your vacations. No respect to their customers at all. I will never ever use Brussels Airlines again."
Hugo,"September 12, 2017",Brussels Airlines,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,2,1,,,1,No,"Flew Economy Class from Tel Aviv do Brussels. No Boarding announcements were being made, they simply started to process the people who had started to queue up. No pre-Boarding announcement for Business Class or Gold Card Holders or Families with children. The plane was delayed by 1 hour. No announcements being made about that, and no apologies, neither in the boarding lounge nor on the aircraft. During the 4 hour 11 minutes flight, no entertainment and no free drinks were being offered, only the items they wished to sell and one had to pay for. So not even a glass of water, or a cup of tea or coffee, nothing whatsoever for the 4 hour 11 minute flight! No wonder Brussels Airlines is suffering from such bad Customer Reviews. I have put the airline onto my ‘never again’ list!"

It was very tight and it was hard to plug in earbuds and chargers on the seats. They also have absolutely terrible customer service. I was on the phone with them trying to extend and the woman was yelling at me telling me it was too late and that I should’ve called the day before. I called the day before and I had the 6 attempts recorded in my phone but they dismissed it saying that they would’ve picked up. Also after trying  to reach them, I emailed them that same day that I tried to get through so at least they would see that I tried, and again they dismissed it.They are very hard to reach since they are open only for 3 hours and don’t pick up all the time. I would not recommend this airline to anyone, especially if you need customer service."

Kaloyan,"September 22, 2020",Bulgaria Air,5.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,3.0,3,2,1,1,1,3,1,No,"I have flown with bulgaria air more than 15 times. Mainly because on the routes I flew i didn’t have a better alternative at that certain moment. However, I don’t think I had a flight with them that didn’t have some kind of problem. Once I had to transport my dog and when we landed the ground crew returned the dog cage broken! (They obviously had dropped it while my dog was inside). Once I bought a ticket and I had to travel l for business. When I tried to do the check-in it turned out there is an error in the system and the ticket didn’t exist. Imagine the surprise I felt when I had to buy a 2x more expensive ticket just hours before departure. But maybe the worst thing was when I had to fly from Lisbon back to Bulgaria and just hours before the flight I got an email that it got cancelled. Just a regular day with Bulgaria air. I am bulgarian, travel a lot and honestly am Ashamed of our national carrier. If you have a chance, fly with any other airline just not BG air."

The flight never reached the airport in Frankfurt – we went to Munich instead. I have sent a claim to receive my money back for a transfer from Munich to Frankfurt. They have 2 months to process such a request. Now it is the end of November and after calling many times and following up I have not received any reply. The customer service is very rude and arrogant and they do not even hide that they do not care at all to help you. I am deeply shocked by their impoliteness after each time I call them. Terrible experience, I do not recommend them to anyone."

Delay of flights and luggage, stolen property from the bags and very poor attitude are just the beginning of your journey with this company. Customer Service is practically non-existent. The only official phone number on their web site (+359) 2 402 04 00 does not reply for weeks and the number listed for luggage complains (+359) 2 984 04 14 is invalid. Emails are never answered and the service you’ll get will make you feel like you owe them a favour for using their services. They will wear you down and hope that you’ll give up fighting the wall of bureaucracy they’ve created. I’d rather walk on foot next time then use their services again."

Sylvia,"August 6, 2015",Bulgaria Air,5.6,Flew Economy,3.0,3,3,4,3,,,4,No,I would not recommend this airline. The flight connecting through Paris had contracted staff at the ticket desk who only provided a call center phone number and then promptly packed their things and walked off.

Arthur,"March 8, 2019",Cambodia Angkor Air,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,2,0,1,1,1,No,Booked direct with the airline and paid extra to choose seats and for extra 9kg of luggage each. On checking in the agent ignored this and made us open our cases there and then and transfer luggage between them even though we were well within limits. Suddenly claimed to not speak English when we asked where we could complain. Plane was filthy and cabin was in poor state of repair. Seatbelt signs not working on left side of cabin and my seat wouldn’t stay upright. Light fittings broken and tissues packed around broken window shade. I just hoped the technical maintenance was better than that of the cabin. Not evenna drink of water provided on this flight. I wish I’d have taken heed of the reviews and booked elsewhere. Thinking of booking? Just don’t!

The e-tickets are clearly marked as ‘economy’, and ‘refundable/fees apply’. Cambodia Angkor’s ‘helpdesk’ had to be sent the tickets multiple times before actually looking at them. Having been forced to agree that the tickets are economy, refundable, they say they “assume” that the tickets are a “technical problem”. In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, they continue to claim that the tickets are really low-budget and non-refundable."

Here is the answer I received “Based on your booking class condition, you are required you to come to our head office either in Phnom Penh or Siem Reap to change your flight and you will have to pay USD20.00 per ticket before your flight date and USD30.00 on or after your flight date for the change fee. How could I possibly go to the office to change flight? Then this: Since you wanted to change the unused segment, it will be a bit complicate. Helpdesk never accept the booking over the phone calls or through via email. The only option is you will have to book a new ticket. I ended up going another airline that was very helpful"

Anastasiia,"November 23, 2018",Canaryfly,5.5,Flew Economy Class,3.0,3,3,3,0,,,3,No,"Flies on time. I bought a flight between Las Palmas and Fuerteventura in off-peak season1.5 months in advance at 12 noon (there were earlier flights as well), quite soon they called me that the flight is rescheduled on 8 am (causes huge problems on Fuerteventura to get to the airport in time as public transportation doesn’t function earlier than 7 am – taxi costs 50$ min). Then on a check-in the employee could not find my entry and it took him ~20 mins and several calls to get things sorted out (most likely i was not in 8 am registry list still, as i bought ticket to 12 pm flight initially and someone forgot to update that list), which almost made me late for the flight – got in on final call. Turned out there is no assigned seats at all, so active fast running teenagers occupied all window seats. Then I’ve put my e-book Kindle into seat pocket and forgot it there, contacted the airline 5 hours later after the flight via e-mail saying that i am still around to pick it up, two days later received a reply “sorry, not found anything” – impossible as I was the last leaving the jet and i am 100% positive about leaving my device in the pocket. Greedy crew? Or noone lift a finger about my email replying some default answer? Airline web-site as well as in-flight magazine are purely in Spanish. Yes, definitely the majority of tourists on Canary Island speak Spanish … A very customer-oriented approach… I was flying on Nov 1-4th 2018. Overall not pleasant impression about this airline, avoid if possible."
Sheila,"February 5, 2016",Canaryfly,5.5,Flew Economy,8.0,5,4,4,0,,,3,Yes,"Fuerteventura to Las Palmas with Canaryfly, and a really good value company. The most basic seat price included 6 kg hand baggage and 20 kg hold baggage, plus basic refreshments. Check-in, boarding and flights were all totally without incident. A minor request: tea would be a nice alternative to coffee, but I hear its rival only offers water. The outward flight was no more than half full and the flight back can’t have been more than a third full. With so many non-Spanish local residents and visitors I think it would be a very worthwhile investment for them to provide their website into English. It was clearly the intention (the icon is there) but I’m sure it would pay off to do it sooner rather than later. The market is surely there but I’ve spoken to many local resident expats who had never heard of the company!"
Kelly,"July 11, 2013",Cape Air,10.0,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,0,Yes,"I wish I could remember the pilot’s name; he was delightful! I am a somewhat fearful flier, so the idea of flying on a Cessna 402 was daunting. However, upon boarding, all my fears flew out the (open) window as we taxied for departure from Boston. I’ve never flown a plane this small in my life (Big step) and didn’t know what to expect. I was amazed at the power once the engines were engaged for takeoff…smooth takeoff, glorious flight from Boston to Provincetown (if you’re going up on a shopping trip..much better idea  than driving…trust me) The flight lasted an amazingly short 29 minutes…I could have flown with this guy for hours!!!! I’ll definitely fly Cape Air again…soon, hopefully."

We called in January 2021 to inquire about our refund but were told to call back in March because their refund deparment was swamped. We called back in March, April, May, June, & July and each time were told the same thing. At some point I wrote a letter to BBB describing my experience and shortly after received a message that the merchant issued a refund on August 23, 2021.  Caribbean confirmed that refund was approved on August 23 but would not provide a transaction number. I wrote another letter to BBB and some time later received another response from Caribbean that they processed a refund and asked to wait another two weeks for the refund to be credited to our account.  We spoke with supervisors who promissed to call in the next few days with a transaction number. Naturally they never called back. We received a confirmation for the refund on December 30, 2020 and were refunded on October 7, 2021 after making close to 100 calls to Caribbean and fiing two BBB complaints."

Check-in was incredibly easy as there were very few people in the airport. We were approached by mobility assistance (not the other way around!) and a few moments later we were on our way to security. We were told that the flight price included our exit payment. Once on board, we were soon given our snack. It was a typical Jamaican “doorstep” sandwich with an amazing quantity of fresh, juicy chicken. Then a lovely surprise – an individual Christmas cake for each passenger! They were quite large so we shared one and had the other later. Thank you for that! Soft drinks were complimentary but you could buy alcoholic ones too. Our bags took an age to arrive, but that isn’t the fault of the airline."

Dion,"May 8, 2017",Caribbean Airlines,5.1,Flew Economy,8.0,1,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,My problem is with the donestic flights when will you start treating domestic passengers with just a drop of respect especially after spending 350us for a club card presents it to the agent was still placed on a standby list have to wait over 3 hours for a flight and funny right in front my face workers putting in friends and family on vacant seats …… i still dint not get on a flight and missed a very important meeting. i honestly regret spending that money now….. you all need to treat domestic passengers better than this are we not humans too paying to fly like anyone else…..    i honestly wish there was another domestic airline even if it was 600 to travel to trinidad i would use it am sure i would not miss my classes or any of my meetings. The only benifit of the club card on the domestic bridge is to get on a flight faster or so i thought no am seeing i was wrong and there is no benifit to this card locally …..
Sylvia,"January 5, 2016",Caribbean Airlines,5.1,Flew First,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"I have flown both economy and first class with Caribbean Airlines.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The service is good and there is free in flight entertainment.  The are on time and the pilots are some of the best I have experienced.  Judging by some of the comments I have read, consideration must be taken that it is not always the airlines fault for delays, this airline puts safety first.  I have witnessed passengers being rude and disrespectful to the staff with attitude of entitlement sometimes."
Amanda,"December 31, 2015",Caribbean Airlines,5.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,3,0,,,3,No,"Caribbean Airlines is trash. Not worth flying this airline. We lost a whole day in Jamaica due to delays, and all they gave us was a $15 each voucher for food. We ended up spending $100 in food for the day (airports are expensive), plus gas to drive around and do NOTHING while we waited for our flight. Meanwhile, we could have been eating for free at our all-inclusive resort. When you rarely get a vacation, missing a whole day of a week is worth a lot – a hell of a lot more than $15 each. We SPENT money due to the airline’s delay. I sent a letter to the airline, and received no response. This company is trash!!!!!"

The food is bad and getting worse though. Staff is OK and helpful when asked. Seats cramped however, that is pretty much across the board on the airlines we fly (in economy). I always recommend our visitors fly Caribbean due to the reliability. Alternatives (SLM; Insel Air) are often delayed."
george,"September 23, 2014",Caribbean Airlines,5.1,Flew Economy,2.0,2,2,2,2,,,2,No,"suprised this company has survived the market, saying that there is little competition for the caribbean as British Airways and Virgin have tied up the market. Staff rude, food poor plans dated."

Brian,"January 10, 2024",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,3,3,0,,,0,No,"As a seasoned world traveller, I have flown with pretty much all of the main carriers, and I’m pretty sure I flew with Cathay Pacific around 23 years ago to Singapore. So for my upcoming trip to Phuket via Hong Kong we chose to fly with them again. Having paid a considerable amount of money to fly with Cathay Pacific this time around, I was horrified and extremely disappointed that to reserve seats so that my wife and I could sit together on the 4 flights I had to pay £197.60. This is absolutely daylight robbery! How can they justify this much money for reserving 2 seats! It costs them nothing… they have already taken 1000’s of pounds for my flights and there is no additional administration needed because its all done via computer. It seems to me that they are exploiting a captive audience and playing on the fear of their travellers not being able to sit together on these long haul flights. This will be the last time I ever fly with CP, and I will make it my mission in life to inform my many 1000’s of contacts worldwide to do the same"
Michelle,"June 12, 2023",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Racist airlines, only provide service and respect to white passengers. Ignore all the yellow guests, especially people speaking Mandarin. Even though most of the cabin crew understand the Mandarin, but still provide no respect to the guests. They said, if you can’t say blanket in English, you can’t have it. I don’t understand how such kind of airline can get high rating here. Is it because all the raters are white?"

We were served extremely well  through out the journey . We both are seniors and have used wheel chair  to enable us to assist during travel . Our discovery with CATHAY PACIFIC airline was unique in the way we were served by compassionate kind and extremely helpful staff. Even the air hostess and steward on board were prompt efficient and worked hard to provide us  NOURISHMENTS and snacks in between meals as we take medications and  my wife has diabetes requiring her to eat frequent short snacks . The  ground staff at all airports crew of Cathay pacific all truly amazingly out perform their duties. We are extremely grateful and will frequently use your airlines and surely recommend to all friends and relatives as we have experienced exceptionally great 5 star quality service .Thank you CATHAY PACIFIC TEAM for being punctual on flight and serving us with that infectious smile.

Santosh,"September 8, 2022",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I recently had very bad experience when I was booking my flights via their website and customer service centre. Although my credit card was charged via the online booking I was not able to issue the tickets through their website. When I contacted their customer service centre I got different answers and no help was provided to honour the price I had booked my tickets for through their website. This was my worst customer service experience in my life. I spoke to different customer service agent during the period 5 August to 12 August spending hours to resolve the issue but nobody was able to help me. Hence, I decided to go to the travel agent."
Pattarinee,"August 16, 2020",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Premium Economy Class,3.0,2,4,2,4,4,5,4,No,Cathay’s customer service attitude and its business ethic during the COVID crisis are appalling. They coldly kicked a heavily pregnant woman out of the flight with no alternative remedy and separated her from her disabled mother without taking any responsibility.
Steven,"May 10, 2020",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Business Class,1.0,2,4,1,3,1,1,1,No,"Booked Business class from Mumbai to Hong Kong. 1.Horrific check-in experience at Mumbai.. the guy even insisted on weighing my wife’s brown paper bag with sandwiches… and they ended up charging us $$$ in excess… in fact, more than the cost of another ticket 2.Onboard experience was just pathetic, causing me to wonder how is it possible for a once great airline to now be so Bad and substandard. eg. Flight attendants were slack, impolite and lazy. And..  Halfway through the flight, they ran out of soap in the Business class bathrooms.. yep! No longer can Cathay claim to be a premium airline."
Martin,"December 25, 2019",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,1,1,No,"Last year Cathay cancelled our flight from Fukuoka, Japan to Hong Kong because their plane’s engine could not be fixed.

Priyanka,"June 11, 2019",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,3,0,2,1,3,3,No,"I was traveling from jfk to ccu via Hong Kong 2 days back. First to start with my luggage was man handled and the holder was taken off. I do not even want to get into on what all was damaged in the luggage. My bag was of 200$ and it was an extra luggge for which I paid 220$. After looking at the bag and the inside objects I wonder why did I pay. I should have left it there. I have pictures of that but not sure how to upload it. Secondly the leg from hk to ccu was Cathay dragon, the air hostess was so lazy that inspite of asking for water for 4-5 times I still did not get it."
Jeff,"May 5, 2019",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Economy Class,3.0,2,3,2,3,4,2,1,No,"Sadly I did not have a good experience in a recent trip to and from Hong Kong. 1/ the flight was delayed 7+ hours without explanation, resulting in us cancelling our long-arranged dinner reservation and losing an afternoon’s vacation time. We later found the delay was caused by crew illness. No compensation was offered. 2/ the check-in staff were unsympathetic and unhelpful when I pleaded for my wife and I to be given adjacent seats. Luckily one of the ground crew was much more responsive after more pleading and was eventually able to assist, but the whole process left a sour taste… 3/ the food quality on the flight was, at times, quite awful. A bowl of boiled, unseasoned pasta does not constitute a decent dinner! Following our arrival home, my wife and I both had food poisoning; the only thing we ate in common was the airline food! I have flown with Cathay Pacific previously and each time the flights have been delayed; this was the worst. I am afraid to say I will avoid flying with this carrier again."

Rose,"January 23, 2019",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,3,3,,,2,No,"This Airline Knows how to torture and insult their customer Tried to give us some physical conforms, My husband and I spent $15,690 for a business class return ticket – the economy class would be only $5,000. but I have paid extra $10,000 brought extra mental and physical stress for 9 hour 45 Mins. We have to literally sit next to the toilets. My arm can reach the door of the toilet while I was seated I was closer to the toilet than to the TV. Both toilet doors were facing to the seats of me and my husband. the toilet doors have fully occupied my left side and the right side of my husband’s seat. there were 38 passages in the business class with 3 toilets, if everyone uses toilet 4 times during 9 hours and 45 mins fly, and each time 8 mins; that means each toilet will be used 5 times per hour, and it will be occupied 40 mins every hour. While I was trying to eat my appetizer, the toilet door were opened 6 times, and an old lady – who was accompanied by a nurse, had to keep the toilet door wide open – god knows how long it had been opened. I knew it was likely i would vomit, so I had to move myself to the economy class …. I was told by number of crew members, they have been consistently submit customers complaint to the head office but the airline doesn’t care about this, they just try to sale much space as possible, although they have acknowledged that 2 seat should never exist. Today, I have received a letter from the Customer Relations Executive of this airline, WOW, Great, they offer me USD50 in service vouchers with 9 conditions of use!!!!!"

Check in was efficient, ground staff were courteous, professional and friendly. Requested for extra leg room and was given without any hesitance. As oneworld Sapphires, we were able to access CX lounges in LHR and HKG so we ended up in the Pier Business Class lounge which had everything you need. Food served on board was great. IFE selection was endless. Overall, the best airline option to Asia."
Michael,"December 24, 2018",Cathay Pacific,5.8,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,4,5,5,,,5,Yes,"I flew from Vancouver to Hong Kong direct in economy on Nov 16, 2018. There was a 3.5 hour delay. We were suppose to fly out at 1:15am, and we didn’t depart until 5am. I was offered a $15 meal voucher. Only thing opened at that time was Wendy’s before the security, good thing I thought of that before going through the check point. Other than that, everything else was smooth. No hiccups on the flight, the food was good and the flight attendants were courteous and attentive in offering amenities, refreshments, cup noodles were available the entire flight upon request. My trip back was uneventful, no delays. My family and I have always flown Cathay for their service and comfort, I’m hoping the value stays true even in this economy."
Jon,"November 19, 2016",Cayman Airways,2.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,4,1,,,3,No,"The airline has the worst customer service ever. They did not load our golf bags at JFK, took them 24 hours to locate the bags when we got to Grand Cayman.  Did not authorize purchase of items stored in bags, and even after they found the bags, did not deliver them as promised. To make matters worse, they do not follow through and there is no one to call.  I fly more than 100,000 miles per year and this is worst experience ever, even in the 3rd World."

Maria,"July 5, 2014",Cayman Airways,2.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,The worst experience..After a long adventure..delay..sitting in the airplane for 4 hours..sitting at the airport for 2 hours they cancelled the flight reassuring us that we will fly the next day! The next day we went there..realizing that we will have to share the same airplane with the passenger of today’s flight! They didn’t gave us priority..they left us last! The sits weren’t enough..I didn’t get one! I have to go again tomorrow! Very unprofessional! My flight was from JFK to Cayman islands!
Alfonso,"August 9, 2023",Cebu Pacific,2.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Awful Airline!!! They should be reported to the Civial Aviation Authority because they should not operate at all. Very incompetent pilots. My flight was cancelled yesterday and rebooked to today but again cancelled citing extreme weather conditions while other planes are able to take off from the same airport. Take note that it was sunny all day, not even a chance of rain. Customer service does not even meet the standards of  the lowest of the low airlines. They have no sympathy. They are quicker to cancel flights than make and land flights. Also, they only cancelled my flight 2 hours AFTER boarding time or 1 hour after the intended take off time leaving us no time to plan the rescheduling of flights. They even suggested to rebook my flight for the 3rd time 5 days from today which is ABSURD because my holiday trip including hotels, beach activities and airport to hotel transfers has been paid for and nonrefundable. Missed my bestfriend’s wedding on top of that. I suggest filing a class law suit to this airline. Any help from Filipino lawmakers out there. We can certainly improve the airline services in the philippines."

No text message notifications.  Zero. 4. Cancelled my ticket because this airline is TRULY UNRELIABLE. 5. Booked with another airline at an exorbitant last minute ticket price so I could actually catch my connecting flight. 6. Cancelled with Cebu BECAUSE THEY CANCELED ONE LEG OF MY FLIGHT.

They waste your time your money, No Consideration, they do not care about their customers. They Lied on their Mission and Vision Statements about Customers Being Top Priority. Refund takes 2 months, Cebu Pacific will cancel their flight without any reason Last minute. The Chat Bot will try it’s best so you do not get to talk to a real Live agent. The agent talks like a Bot, there’s no Voice Contact Hotline. Their service Sucks. Do Not waste your time and money with this Low Cost airline, You Have been Warned!

Alina,"July 26, 2022",Cebu Pacific,2.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,No,"It’s funny that you are so strict with check-ins when probably 90% of your flights are always delayed. Silay Airport is such a small airport for you not to consider a late check-in when it would only take what, 2 minutes to go from check-in to the boarding gate, to think the airplane just stayed there in the airport for the next 30 minutes. We were only some 5 minutes beyond check-in, would it bankrupt the company to show a bit of consideration? Your staff at the Silay Airport are nothing but upscaled cashiers, only trained to repeatedly offer a rebooking. They lack proper judgement and definitely proper customer service training… THE SUPERVISOR INCLUDED. This is probably the worst airline in the entire world — DO NOT BOOK A FLIGHT HERE."
Al,"March 12, 2020",Cebu Pacific,2.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"Cebu Pacific’s travel insurance is a sham, a waste of money. The coverage says it includes cancellation due to the death of a family member, but  they did everything the could to avoid reimbursement, when my father died in December of 2019.  When he died on the day after Christmas, 2019, I canceled my planned travel (which was supposed to start the very next day), including all my flights.  Cebu Pacific then said that because I canceled my flights, I had canceled my travel insurance, and they refused to reimburse me.  More confusing was that after my initial claim request, Cebu Pacific asked me for personal information, a death certificate for my father, my own birth certificate to establish our relationship, and my trip information for that trip, including flights not on Cebu Pacific itself. I provided all of this, but then I was told they were refusing to reimburse their flights.  I have every reason to believe that Cebu Pacific will exercise every possible way to avoid reimbursing a travel insurance claim, regardless of the reason, or the proof/documentation the customer provides."

Within the region, they usually have cheaper prices 1. Beware using the website. Most add- ons are automatic UNTIL you manually decline. 2.  Flight delays the norm. Terrible communication to passengers. 3.  Gate areas often look like “homeless shelters.” 4. Crew behavior very lax, often unprofessional. They know its a “cheap alternative.” You will see crew members yelling casual conversations across aisles. I assume overworked, often forget passenger requests. 5.  Food:Cups of Ramen, soda. 6.  Baggage.Zero tolerance.They often weigh carry on while you are in que and a second time at check in counter! Since they staff “bare bones” expect bags to be late. 7. No one to complain to. Missed flights, etc. Very hard to find someone of authority. They keep their offices hidden. “Supervisors” are lowest level, and have no authority. 8.  “If you don’t like it, just sue me!”  Historically they have many aeronautical and consumer violations in the Philippines. They know you have very little legal recourse. That’s how they make their money!"

Chi Yuen James,"November 14, 2018",China Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,7.0,3,3,4,4,,,4,Yes,"I had my first flight by China Airlines CI922 on 25 December 2017 from Hong Kong HKG to Taipei TPE and my return flight CI 927 on 28 December 2017 from Taipei TPE to Hong Kong HKG. The whole journey is great. The round tickets is about HKD2000. It departs on Christmas so this price is sensible. I feel comfortable even I sit on the Economy Class. CI922 use A330-300 and CI927 use B737-800. The seat pitch and width are 31-32 and 17-18 on both planes. I think it’s normal compared to other airlines. The staff are very nice and gorgeous. They will help you immediately if you need. They have a splendid smile which makes people feel comfortable. In the plane, they serve minced pork rice and beef noodles. I selected minced pork rice and it’s very tasty. The meal included an orange juice, a cup of water, a bread and the main dish. It’s very enough for a normal man like me. It only serves one meal as it just a two-hour flight. It has a wide choice of in-flight entertainment. Many famous movies and films are included in the system. Unfortunately, I cannot finish the whole movie in an ultra-short haul route."
Shaily,"January 3, 2018",China Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,3,,,3,No,"Hi Support, This is to bring to your notice that China Southern Airlines will be our last choice after what we are facing now. We are tourist and we travelled from New Delhi to Sydney via Flight no. CZ 325. After a long and tiring journey of 14hrs when we landed to Sydney and done with our immigration. We were waiting for our luggage at the baggage claim. We waited and waited….All the passengers received their luggage and left but we kept on waiting and then got to know the shock of our life that our baggage has not arrived. The flight landed at 9:20am and till 11:30am we waited for our luggage when we got acquainted with the missing baggage news. What insane thing it is new place, we have come to have fun and our baggage not there with us. We don’t even have a set of garments to even change. Total exploitation when yours people compensat by giving $50 per baggage. You guys should understand the pain one goes without clothes and you are asking us to enjoy the place. It’s been a torture to land after 14hrs of journey and then go for forceful shopping of clothes that too at $50. Kindly look into this matter and provide us with our luggage and also compensate us for the mental imbalance you have done to us. Kind Regards, Shaily"

On the way back, about to leave Taipei to San Francisco, they checked our tickets 3x because someone at the check counter misplaced their half."
Doris,"May 3, 2017",China Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy,1.0,2,2,1,3,,,1,No,We were 4 persons. All the tickets were purchased at the same time. When I tried to do the check in online I couldn’t. Later that day one of the other passengers tried and she succeeded but everyone was sitting far from each other and no option to change the sits. Not nice. The way back another adventure to make the check in online. We managed to change the sits but when arriving at the airport the sits given were the ones initially assigned and not the ones we choose during the online check in. No willingness to please a costumer…China Airlines never again!!!

My returning flight from SFO-TPE-SIN now had an 8-hr layover instead of a 2-hr layover because China Airlines was no longer operating the flight that I had previously selected. Despite my many calls to Expedia to mediate this with China Airlines over 1 1/2 weeks, no appropriate options were given. China Airlines would give me a full  refund, but not reimburse me for the higher ticket fares that I would incur since I would be booking just 3 weeks before my date."

Joe,"December 7, 2016",China Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy,2.0,3,4,4,1,,,4,No,"I was on a LONG flight 18 hours in total. When your on a long flight the on board entertainment is very important. This flight had 2 parts. The secound part there was NO VIDEO at all. I was very unhappy. On the first half of the trip there were only 4 or so english speaking movies. All of them were over 30 years old. So it was not really entertainment. There were a bunch of Chinese movies that I don’t find interesting at all because I don’t know what the the movie is about. I was so bored and unhappy. I started tipping the stewerdess with dollar bills to see what would happen. It was a little entertaining. Because she did not know what to do, She would say thank you and then turn red. That was my entertainment for the first 10 hours. NOT GOOD AT ALL"

Peter,"July 19, 2016",China Airlines,6.2,Flew Premium Economy,9.0,5,4,5,5,,,3,Yes,"Flew LAX-TPE-LAX.  This was aboard their new livery of 777 in Premium Economy class.  Gracious service throughout, only disappointment was smaller portions of food compared to EVA Air’s Premium Economy class, otherwise very close indeed between these top two airlines of Taiwan.  Entertainment system is by far the BEST I’ve ever experienced, hands down.  Even on 14 hour flight, you will NOT get Bored with their great selection of latest and classic movies, music, shows, etc.  Gracious attentive service.  Seat comfort is OK, but not 100% great.  Excellent legroom because China Airlines’s new 777’s innovative seat recline does not affect your legroom even if passenger in front has their recline all the way back, this doesn’t affect you — so lots of legroom space!!  Like I said, only letdown was smallish portion of food, but grade A in everything else.  Prompt take off and arrival times both ways."
Simon,"June 9, 2016",China Airlines,6.2,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,3,,,3,No,"I am a 77 year old passenger on wheelchair. When I was on transit at TPE airport, after waiting for more than 3 1/2 hours, I asked the ground staff if they can wheel me to the boarding gate so that I can wait there. One of the ground staff young ladies told me that since I can still walk, I should walk there myself!!!! When I complained about her attitude  at the transit counter, the other ground staff there told me that I can go and complain to the management about this! I’m not going to travel via China Airlines anymore if I need to transit in Taipei. The ground staff there are just too rude! I’ve heard that the ground staff of China Airlines in Taipei has bad attitude but I never expect them to treat an old man in wheel chair this way."
Bryan,"January 22, 2020",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Booked this flight for my 73 year old mother who a month prior had had her knee replaced. Wheelchair assistance was booked for every leg of her UK to Melbourne flight. However, when she got to Pudong, China Eastern staff treated her like garbage for her 11 hour stopover in which she was given no assistance. Staff yawned in her face, turned their back on her and refused to look at paperwork confirming the wheelchair had been arranged. Apparently wheelchairs were only for security personnel?!? Even worse service was to follow with some mumbled email apology came a week later which was then ignored when I replied to it. Phones are never answered. Finally got a second email from someone a few weeks later, no idea who as they had no signature to their email, which ignored all the issues raised in the complaint and said “I’m sorry that we didn’t receive your service at the first time. It’s extremely inconvenient for your subsequent itinerary. Next time I come to Pudong, please email me in advance. I’ll let our regional manager come to protect you!” Oh, and also the Vegetarian meal on the flight was either fish or chicken."
Michael,"January 14, 2020",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,3.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Flight MU 736 Sydney to Shanghai on a B787 Dreamliner Economy Class with seating being 3,3,3 across. This was an overnight flight and heavily booked. The staff were quite friendly but the boarding procedure left a lot to be desired. Airlines that board passengers in the rear rows first make for a much better passenger experience, sadly this was not the case. Food service was somewhat haphazard with delivery of the bread roll occurring well after the meal was finished. As for the meal it was palatable, just! On our return flight to Australia it was just the same. I would not fly China Eastern again. Provided ear piece had the worst sound I have ever encountered."
charlie,"December 6, 2019",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,No,"China Eastern Airlines gave a really bad response when our flight was cancelled. None of the contact numbers including the 24 hour emergency number were responding, we have video evidence of this. They were rude and looked like they had a lack of training because they were unsure of what to do. I wouldn’t recommend China Eastern Airlines and would never fly with them again. I am a regular flyer and this by far has been the worst airline. To save yourself time, money and your own safety I would look at other airlines even if it means paying the extra little bit of money because you will regret it otherwise."

Ben,"August 18, 2019",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,4,1,2,1,3,1,Yes,"China Eastern, You pay cheap believing it is just a good bargain but the reality is more complicated. The Airplanes are relatively new but the maintenance on board is very low. Broken USB plugs, broken control for the entertainment system, broken headphones jack, broken lock in the lavatory etc. Unlike other Asian airlines from Thailand, Hong Kong or Singapore which provides a superb service, CE provides very basic service, not to say rough… It is all very technical without any understanding of what service means. Don’t expect a smile or nice gesture, you won’t get it. One lovely thing is the free WIFI access on the flight, but don’t be happy just yet.. it is so restricted to western site that you can forget about Google, Facebook, Instagram, most messaging apps, Yahoo search etc.. it is Chinese and made for Chinese, for Chinese based sites it seems to be working just fine! Eventually, when I arrived at my destination, I’ve noticed major damage to my suitcase. I’ve reported the damage etc. 3 months passed and I haven’t got any compensation yet. China Eastern doesn’t respond on Facebook, on their website or to emails. They are practically not there. Dreadful service!!"
Max,"April 22, 2019",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,1,3,,1,2,No,"Absolutely rude staff at the check in. We were travelling as a couple and were given two seperate seats 30 rows apart. This is given that we tried to check in online 24hrs before the flight and their website did not let us check in online with unclear error messages. We asked staff to see if they could reunite us given that my wife was pregnant and I couldn’t leave her alone for the duration of the flight. Staff were very reluctant to help and had a very aggressive and rude attitude towards us. It looked like staff were not expecting such a simple request and were looking at us as if we were criminals for making such a request! When we got onboard, we saw lots of seats are empty and could have easily been allocated to us. We asked the crew and they changed our seats eventually, but it was a shame this was not done by check in staff in the first place! Very bad experience with this airline. In-flight service was mediocre and very basic."
Gena,"March 23, 2019",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,3,3,1,1,No,Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Horrendous customer service. Paid for seats together didn’t get them. Got no explanation why and there was no manager to talk to. When I called customer service they hung up on me. Do not care about their customers at all. The flight was so cold. It was freezing to the point of discomfort and pain. The food was disgusting and so wasteful because people were barely eating it. Terrible airline. Avoid.
lisa,"March 14, 2019",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Business Class,1.0,0,3,1,3,2,1,1,No,the worst service from the inflight crew to the ground staff and gate agents. absoulutley  disscusting service  and lack of consumer compassion as my wife had a broken leg and we arranged for a wheel chair through there customer service. it never arrived . we had to wait 20 minutes in the rain in shanghai on the tarmac. ounce one showed up . it was a kids size and the took her just inside the gate door to tell her to get off they need it for another 6 customers.from the same flight . every china staff member that we spoke to could not speak English and basically laughed in are face and walked away.it took another 40 minutes to get a chair .unfortunately there is not enough room to write a full review so go to skytrax or yelp or google review and look for lisa  . the staff was so rude and disrespectful that I would never recommend it to anyone
Steph,"January 22, 2019",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,2,No,"Last minute trip booked for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children, 6 yrs and 2 yrs) from SH (PVG airport) to MEL (1 way) for 5/1/19, due to sudden death of my grandmother in SH. Was originally scheduled to fly back to MEL from HK but had to double back to SH and Cathay did not have any available flights to MEL til 12/1/19. Had to settle with China Eastern Airlines as they flew direct to MEL. MU739 was due to depart SH at 12:20am on 5th Jan. By the time we reached the gate, we had already been awake for 22 hours (funeral was on the morning of 4th Jan). Was advised by ground staff at gate to bring stroller onto bus and give to ground staff on tarmac to ensure it is taken on board. There was not a single soul on tarmac when the bus arrived next to the plane, either to control foot traffic or to receive my stroller. Most passengers (being Chinese) scrambled to get off the plane and crowd onto the staircase leading to the entrance of the plane, the bitter cold and wet weather did not help matters. CE Airlines has a policy of re-scanning boarding passes right before boarding the plane (to avoid abscondees?) which they decided to carry out half way up the covered staircase. This created a bottleneck situation with more than half of the bus passengers left on the tarmac exposed to the cold and rain. I had no choice but to carry the folded stroller, along with carry-on luggage and trying to hold on to my 6 yr old daughter, up the slippery and over-crowded staircase. She slipped and fell 3 times along the way. My husband was carrying our 2 year old son and was ahead of me. When I eventually got to the entrance of the plane, my arms gave way (under excess strain) and both the stroller and suitcase fell onto the floor. A flight attendant asked why I brought the stroller up and I explained angrily that there was no ground staff to receive it and that I brought it up in fear that it would have been left behind otherwise. I also criticized that the re-scanning of boarding passes half way on a staircase was a bad practice and ill-conceived. I further said that the lack of crowd control and the wet weather posed safety risks. At this point the Cabin Manager (Yong WANG) intervened and said I was being disrespectful to cabin crew who are trying to help. I said I have not received any assistance since departure gate and that CE Airlines has poorly implemented and unsafe practices. This quickly turned into an heated argument where he accused me of being rude and unappreciative while I insisted it’s the company’s policies that I’m criticizing. In an attempt to de-escalate the situation, I told him I wanted to get to my seat. He responded by physically blocking me and shoving me when I tried to go around him. He further demanded my passport details and boarding pass and threatened that I could not stay on the flight. I managed to move away from him eventually when two other boarding passengers directed me an alternative passage way. I found my seat and rejoined my family and explained to my husband what had happened at the entrance of the plane (being ahead of me, he did not witness the whole incident). I also obtained WANG’s name and title from a helpful flight attendant at the back of the plane. I thought this was the end of the unpleasantness. I was very wrong. After about 15 minutes, a security officer approached me to say that the WANG has recommended that I be escorted off the flight, that I posed a threat to the safety of other passengers. I asked to speak with a higher ranking office who turned out to be the Captain (Jiang LI). I asked the basis for denying me carriage and he cited that I was emotionally unstable and that it was not safe for the rest of the passengers. I tried my best to explain what had happened (in rudimentary Chinese, as I left China as a small child and only possess very basic Chinese language skills). LI claimed that had I apologised to WANG before the security officer arrived, he could have overlooked the incident. And that i need to face the consequences of my behaviour (which was giving negative feedback about unsafe practices?). What’s particularly memorable was a small exchange between LI and WANG, a knowing look and smile, as well as a remark by WANG that I almost attacked him (I’m a 1.6m petite asian woman, compared to WANG who is at least 1.8m and twice my build). Throughout this whole exchange, I repeated asked an interpreter which was denied by crew staff and the security office. My husband came to find me at this point and the two of us were given about 30 seconds to decide whether I would deplane by myself or my entire family of four would leave. Cabin staff also promised that there would be ground staff to assist with alternative flight and accommodation options. Worried about my well-being being left behind by myself; the fact that the two children were already unwell and whether there would be more more unpleasantness for the rest of my family if they elected to stay and most importantly, relying on their promise that there would be assistant on ground, we decided to leave the flight as a family. It was only after we arrived at the departure hall that we discovered there was no one to assist us, apart from two lowly ranked employees who brought our checked-in luggage. There was counter staff at check-in or customer service, all airline personnel had left as it was their last flight of the day. We were then told to wait by the customer service counter until 6am. I asked about accommodation and was told there was no one to arrange it. As this was a last minute trip to attend a loved one’s funeral service, we did not even carry much Chinese currency on us (Currency exchange was also closed), we did not have local sim card to make phone calls or even internet access as the airport wifi is limited to local phone numbers. We were not informed there was a nearby airport hotel we could have used, but as we found the next day, there was zero vacancy anyway. We ended up being stranded at the airport from 12.30am to 6.30am, when a on-duty CE manager showed up. During those 6 hours, I carried our 2 year old the entire time while he slept and our 6 year old huddled up in the stroller to rest. We were completely helpless and near the point of collapse as we had been awake for 24 hours by then. I pleaded to be transferred to a different airline on account of the horrific experience, which was denied. I was in tears when I asked for temporary hotel accommodation as the next available flight was more than 12 hours away (7.45pm on 5th Jan), or even an empty office to rest in, which was also rejected. I used the customer service counter’s desk phone to call customer service but all they could offer was to establish a case but had no power to arrange for anything. We ended up taking a taxi back to a relative’s residence to get some privacy and rest before making our way back to PVG for the 7.45pm flight, which thankfully got us back to Melbourne. My children suffered high fevers for two day after our return due to the exposure they suffered on the tarmac and at the airport. My husband and I missed two days of work due to the physical toll of this ordeal and having to care for the two sick children. Since this incident, I have followed up on average twice a day with the Shanghai based customer service, I also contacted the Sydney office (as the Melbourne office never picks up calls). I sent two lengthy emails with photos attached as proof for the traumatizing experience. To date, all I have received are broken promises (to call within 24/48 hours), hand-balling of my complaint (to ground staff team) and poor English speakers who struggle to communicate and understand (surely, it’s unreasonable to expect all of their passengers to be native Chinese speakers?!). I am now pursuing legal action against CE Airlines. China Eastern Airlines are single-handedly responsible for the most traumatizing and humiliating experience of my life. If you value your consumer’s rights, safety and most of your dignity as a human being, do not travel with them and warn everyone you know not to travel with them."

Very few choices if you do not eat meat or seafood. It was basically pork/shellfish or shellfish. However, on request they do cater."
NICOLE,"October 4, 2017",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"avoid this China Eastern airline…. you have been warned my father had the heart attack, in Nanjing airport due to the irresponsible flight changing in China. he arrived at the shenyang airport three hours early to catch the flight to nanjing, however, his flight has been rescheduled to 5hrs behind the original flight, he did remind the crew that he will not catch the transit flight in Naningjing and show them the print out ticket. He saw there is a flight that will enable him to catch the Nanjing flight, but the crew insist to put him on the 5 hours later flight and tell him not to worry about it, his flight has been re-scheduled. but no one tell him the flight has been rescheduled to the next day from a different depart city, and no one told him the reason of the flight re-scheduling, which is very unprofessional and irresponsible. When he realized he could not catch the flight the same in Nanjing, he requested an explanation from the airline. Due to the bad customer service and his health condition, he had a heart attack at Nanjing airport, and faint out, the ambulance did him a rescue and took him to the nanjing hospital that night. as his family, who was waiting half day at Sydney airport, and has to call the airport to find where he is, why he did not arrive as scheduled, and not one tell us what happened. we nearly lost him and not beside him while he was fighting for life in the hospital. He had the chance to catch the flight in shenyang, but no one has scheduled him in. Not sure is there anyone has to took his seat and make him to reschedule the flight? He could rest at Shenyang if cannot catch the same flight to Sydney, instead of spending a night at Nanjing airport. The way that Shenyang crew changing his flight is very difficult to understand and we request a fair explanation. He has overcome his bad health situation, he finally make it to Sydney. i saw him had difficulty in breathing. I took him to the doctor straight way, hope everything is all right. We are requesting the explanation from China Eastern Airline for the unprofessional and irresponsible flight changing, it has been 7 days now, the airline told us that the shenyang crew could not see the transit flight in the system. that is all the response we have for this matter."
David,"August 16, 2017",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Business,2.0,2,4,3,3,,,2,No,"Bad experience overall.  AFter a reasonable check in service, I entered the China Eastern club lounge which could best be described as a cafeteria full of running screaming children.  The food service is just basic and the lounge ambience is dreadful.  My flight was posted as delayed and the staff offered no information.  When queried the desk staff became angry and defensive.   Even the duty staff manager had no clue as to what was happening with my flight.  So, if there is any flight operations management with this airline, they have no care to communicate flight issues or amended plans with passengers.   After a seven hour delay and no information at any time, the flight was randomly announced as ‘boarding’.  Only to find they had boarded the plane notwithstanding ATC advice to hold on the boarding gate for another hour.  The staff on board tried to be helpful, but are clearly just the puppets of a lousy management structure.  The ‘western’ breakast was inedible.  Boiled noodles with eggs, really!  The scrambled eggs themselves covered in some tomato sauce, and highly salted sausages cooked to death.   The next meal no better.  Then a stupid closure of all devices 1/2 hour prior"
Brianna,"July 26, 2017",China Eastern,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,2,,,1,No,"Trip from hell. The Staff was so unhelpful when I tried to ask questions they Did not want to speak English with me even though they were capable. There was No explanation of why my flights were cancelled or delayed and they would not make other arrangements for connecting flights that I had missed. When flights were cancelled they put us up in some shady hotel, did not tell us where we were going or what the name of the hotel was and did not tell us when we were getting on another flight. Finally after a few calls to the Canadian embassy they said the flight crew should have notified me that I am leaving for the airport in an hour but they told me nothing. So I got ready and finally someone came to my door saying the shuttle is leaving in 15 minutes. Like yea, thanks. Announcements were all in Chinese on flights, the seats are so uncomfortable in economy class the flights were always freezing cold and the food sucked. This was the most unhelpful and unkind Arline I have ever taken. I don’t wish this experience on anyone. I will not take or recommend China eastern ever. Just don’t do it."

I felt like an extradited prisoner during the whole flight.The flight made unknown stop in Qingdao that was not listed in the ticket; makes you get out of the plane and go through security and put you back on the same plane again(whats the point?). cannot use cell phone in airplane mode as well, but can use a laptop(dont get this logic either). Worst of all  I was told that I would claim the baggage in Kathmandu(final destination) during my checking in Denver, but they made me claim the baggage in Kunming where I had to stay with my luggage for 17 hours layover; the return flight was as painful as well The flight experience is total disaster as well; they treat you like a worst class criminal: when the flight attendant asks you to close the window and if you open in between, they come and yell at you, if they tell you open the window and if you close it, they come and yell; if you ask for additional food or drinks after the serving time, they tell you its over; chinese security stole my duty free item in the security as well without letting me know."

Only a few weeks before we left China Southern changed our booking to Guangzhou-Hangzhou with only 1.40 hours between flights at Guangzhou. With the holidays booked we had no choice but to accept the change. Arrival at Guangzhou: no one waiting to help us (promised in Melbourne). Rushed everywhere, but arrived at the gate only 1 minute!!! after closing. The airplan had not even closed the door. But no effort from the personnel to try to give help getting us on board. Closed is closed. As we had done everything we could we expected China Southern to change our tickets so we could get home. Being sent from one desk to another the only answer we got was that flights were on time and they had no influence on immigration for the time they take. No new tickets to get home, and the way we were treated was terrible. After 3 hours of discussions we had to buy new tickets to get home! At home we complained again at the customer service, but again the same answer. This airline is a disgrace!"
Amanda,"December 7, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Out of the 75+ times I’ve flown this was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. After two weeks in Thailand we arrived at Phuket airport at 2AM only to find out our flight was cancelled. Not a big deal – the airline representative quickly rebooked us for a flight on a different airline and sent us to a hotel for a couple hours of sleep. When we arrived back at the airport at 9AM, we were told we didn’t have tickets and were sent to information, where we were told the airline representative never booked us those flights because she said they were full and instead booked us for one at midnight that night – in 15 hours. Information confirmed that the flight was in fact NOT full, but couldn’t make any changes since the airline themselves had to make them. So – for 3 hours – until the flight we wanted to be on took off – we tried to contact China Southern Airlines but they would not answer their phones. We tried calling other airports, but their China Southern staff said they wouldn’t help us. We tried the hotline, who said all they could do was write a report. Needless to say we missed that flight and it wasn’t until 5PM that a China Southern Airlines Rep showed up. When we explained the situation they were cold and unapologetic, refused to upgrade our flight or even let us pay to upgrade our flight, and didn’t even offer meal vouchers. We argued with her for 20 minutes before walking about. Overall it took almost 48 hours for us to get home and we had the worst customer service experience you could ever imagine. Never flying with them again."
Brett,"October 25, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,4,1,3,,,4,No,I was flying from Melbourne to Guangzhou through China Southern.I have to take next flight from there. I used to fly through Singapore Airlines generally but this was second time I have visited through China southern as my friend was also flying through same flight. I carry same baggage in all airlines and no one has objected but China Southern start measure dimensions of BOOK IN luggage.They said SUM of LENGTH + WIDTH + HEIGHT should not more than 158 cm irrespective of weight. If dimensions are more than 158 then they charge $200.I felt they want to charge $200 by any means. Ground staff did not co operate as well and nobody was ready to listen to me. Be careful with baggage in China Southern Airlines otherwise you have to pay extra at the time of check in.
Cajus,"September 10, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,4,1,4,,,1,No,"We had flight from Guangzhou to Amsterdam. It starts already at the check-in, we were two adults and one child, they placed us in different rows although there was enough space in the plane. Then during starting a chinese Lady was still using her mobile phone, we informed a Stewardess, but she did nothing. The food and beverage service is not better, the wine was reallly bad quality and the quantity you get is maybe 0,05l, actually nothing. The western breakfast was finished after one third of the plane was served,… I try China Southern from time to time and hope there service becomes better, but each time I’m disappointed. Actually there planes are quite new and there flight schedule is also good, but the service is a big problem."
David,"September 4, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,5,4,,,3,No,"What is there to say, Well best to be objective, I have traveled a lot, I have been to twenty countries with numerous internal flights as well as many flights while in the military my flight to Philippines via china was possibly the best flight I have ever had, Feeling I had done well in my choice I had no idea what was to come, I traveled from Cebu to Manila nothing said on air Asia flight, I took shuttle bus from one terminal to another nothing said, Then I arrived and tried to check in for return flight, It is best I say first part of this nightmare was not China southerns fault, At counter I was told International runway closed due to Chinese airliner crash landing delays for up to eight hours, Well this extended and extended and ended up being 24 hours but great it is clear lets get out of hear I thought still time to be back for work Monday glad I booked to have 1 and a half days rest, China southern airways well hours and hours later time to get a boarding pass three and a half hours in a line to get a boarding pass, Here is the problem booking was changed again and again, By this time there are 10 of thousands of people in the terminal everywhere they were sleeping, Then we started to see flight attendants walking the halls with flight numbers as nobody could hear the speakers because of so many people all airlines but China southern it seems a man I met in line from England living in France and an Asian man living in US were sitting with me passing the time the English man went to the toilet and came running back and said they have given final call for our flight we ran to the gate got there to be told no we have closed now we said it over the speakers that nobody could hear? So hear we go again they tried to blame us until the number of passengers had reached eight people left behind funny enough nearly all were European a thing I have noticed often in my short dealings with this country, Ok so this is now over 48 hours since I was meant to be on flight and over 50 hours since I left my new wife to return for work in Australia, The story about calls over the load speakers was not the first untruth spoken by this airline, So ok they will organised again so a few hours later lady came is with sign with new flight on so we run to gate wait in line then they tell us to sit down until all booked passengers were seated, Then they said two passengers had not turned up, We thought great I was first to arrive at gate I should get a seat then suddenly 10 minutes later much longer than they gave us on previous flight when they closed door the passengers turned up and they held flight for them to get on not to put a finer point on it but passengers were Chinese? So then they closed doors and left with us still waiting there all off us were very upset and stated if they could not look after there passengers then give us our money back so we could organize ourselves they gave us some left over economy class meals and all there staff left without saying anything ? Ok then later we were moved out into the hall again and the lady left without saying a thing a now normal trend, so after waiting a few more hours a new flight came in and we finally got on This was 55-57 hours after we arrived at the airport and this was for the 2 and a half hour leg to China I thought great I only have a 2 hour wait for flight to Australia because we asked and they said ask when we get to China well I got there and they said no flight today now you have to stay in China and you must get Visa for being hear? But we will give you accommodation because your flight is 9.30 pm tomorrow night by this time I have been away for over 60 hours I was starting to actually see things moving that were not there, So I thought at least I could get some sleep well no directions just a picture on paper how to get to station for accommodation and this airport is huge and I mean huge so half an hour later I found what was on picture, Ok now am organized, Lady comes and guides myself and one other to a station wagon in pick up neither the lady or the driver spoke and English so it took some convincing to get us in unmarked car, But I was to tired to fight anymore so of we went with a strange women in an unmarked car in a country I was not meant to be? I found myself awake again as I watched the driver fight to stay awake drifting across lanes, But thankfully we made it alive much further away from airport than I expected We go to counter myself and a young man from Korea who spoke English to find out no staff behind the counter spoke English at all< Though hand signs and showing vouchers and passport they got the message and booked us in, And again to be fair the room was beautiful, So as I had not ha a shower for nearly three days now was the time I enjoyed a shower then fell asleep in a very comfortable bed 10 hours lady I am in the lobby again trying to indicate that voucher was only for a bed but not food and as I was not meant to be in country I had no local currency and I had not had food since the flight so duty manager came out who ha a small amount of English and I explained an at the end he said noodles or rice I thought this was an offer so I said noodles would be nice he shook his head and left, but never came back? So after nearly an hour I packed my bag and went back to reception and told then I wanted to go back to airport, The duty manager came out and pointedd to boarding pass that showed that it was then over nine hours till my flight so I explained that would be a day since I had had foo so not taking the hint he ordered the shuttle to take me back to airport then finally I could change some money and get some food at burger king where nobody can speak English? I waited at the airport ha a drink of coke walked an walked to pass the time then it came to flight time an first thing they said was flight is delayed for 30 minutes? Ok I can survive this Then it came in Chinese of course so all the Chinese lined up before we even new what was happening so finally got on flight Now is the time to mention that I have had a slipped disk in my back torn the cartilage in both knees multiple time an tore all ligaments in my right side of my ankle over the years and as you get older they all come back to haunt you, So everything hurt, So for the first time in my life I asked to be upgraded so I could have some leg room I showed them paperwork that showed I was meant to be home three days ago and that I was in exhausted and in a lot of pain the stewardess said I will talk to the supervisor an she never came back? So two hours later when they came back I finally snapped and when she offered me me food I said no thank you and f**k this airline, Hear is the last twist they allowed a couple of Chinese to go forward and return just before landing and when I got up first and all but ran down hallway to get out off plane there was only two people in the entire business class so thank you very much China southern airways (I will not be back) David Anderson flight to Manila via China 27th July meant to return Friday 19th but arrived home afternoon 22nd Losing $400 Aus of work Thanks again. (All that I have said hear is true)"
Parvane,"September 4, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"They do not send any information about the ticket that they sell. We bought the ticket 5 months before the departure date and Southern China Airlines did not provide any information about the transit situation and even the information was not on their website! We denied onboarding just because they did not provide any information on their website about having a visa of China for a 3-hour stop!!!. We had very dramatic days and we had to buy a very expensive ticket instead because we had to be back in Australia on time. When we contacted them they did not accept any responsibility. Definitely, we will follow this legally, but by writing this review at least we prevent another drama for someone else. So, I do not recommend this airline to anyone looking for peace of mind!"
Bobby,"September 4, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Business Class,6.0,4,4,3,2,,,2,No,"Business class Sydney to LHR and back again. I have flown China Southern too many times, this is only the second time I have been able to reserve a seat number online, before that their website wouldn’t work. China Southern do a great job of butchering a perfectly good Dreamliner. Sat next to one another, no privacy. The food is very ordinary and quite honestly most of the staff don’t speak anywhere near an acceptable level of English. The new security Nazis at Guanghou make life a misery. We now have to clear their inefficient security, where they don’t know the meaning of ‘express lane’ and all staff have the attitude of a cut snake. Every time now my seat number has changed after I’ve booked it. What’s the point? Twice I’ve been asked to move seats to cater for one of their own. But it’s cheap and I guess you get what you pay for. I’m now going to try China Airways and fly into Gatwick, I have had good reports about them. One thing I would definitely say is that I would not trust any of their airline staff in an emergency, they are weak and would be the first out of the plane. That’s just my opinion of course."
Adam,"January 5, 2018",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,4,,,4,Yes,"I have flown China Southern many times and every time they have been wonderful to me. The food can be a little different for Westerners as it is Chinese fair, but if you give it a try you will find it always fresh and tasty. I like the small things like on long haul they still give you those nice little goody bags with socks and a toothbrush. Plus being a big man all airlines can be uncomfortable, but China Southern is one of the few who goes out of their way to sit me with a spare seat beside me if they possibly can, which is not only great for my comfort but means I am not encroaching on another persons space. The English of the crew can have a strong accent, so listen carefully, but they are patient and very kind and will help even if you have to ask them to repeat themselves. China Southern is easily my second favourite Airline in the World, behind only Air New Zealand."
Michele,"December 12, 2017",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"I was in Bali last week while the volcano was spewing ash and airports/airlines were closing. On Dec 2nd I went to the airport for my flight leaving Denpasar at 1am Dec 3rd,Flight Number: CZ0626. There, I was told by China Southern Airlines that my flight had been cancelled, and it was up to me to make phone calls to change my flight and book a new one. I had no help from the airline and we all felt abandoned and unsafe there in Bali. When I had my travel agency call, they were told the China Southern help desk we needed to use was CLOSED and could not help, but to try to book a new flight with a different airline on our own and call back Monday to talk about getting a refund for my cancelled flight. So after I booked a flight with a different airline that was flying, we called China Southern, and they would not issue a refund! After they told us we were cancelled and could not help us, now they wont give me my money back! I am being told that some agent in Jakarta (Agent # 13553) issued me a new ticket…. but I don’t even know how this would have happened. neither me, or my agent had been informed of such a transaction. To give someone a reservation with no authority, no permission, no information, no confirmation and then when the person doesn’t know about that flight and will not be issues a refund is simply unlawful. I will never deal with this airline again. NOT ONLY were we left to fend for ourselves in an unstable natural disaster situation, but then when we do what we are told, we are lied to and wont be given our money back for a ticket me were not able to use due to the airline’s cancellation…. NOT MY CANCELLATION. A China Southern Airlines agent changed my ticket without me knowing it and now that’s all they have on record. and every phone agent I speak to tells me its my problem I missed my flight. WHAT? This airline is a scam. They will not help you when you are in danger, and then they will steal you money."
Irma,"August 16, 2017",China Southern,4.4,Flew Economy,1.0,1,4,4,4,,,4,No,You loose what you saved on CS ticket on your connection flight; food and any of your planned activities. Total delay on 2-legged flight was never less then 4 hours.  Baggage lost 2 times from 4 family trips. Doesn’t worth it at all.

As a westerner and someone who doesn’t usually stick around one location for long, having to purchase/make the local credit and to visit retail shops are not really convenient for me. I hope they’d accept Internation cards soon and I wish someone would’ve given me a heads-up."

Telling us the airport is closed, the airport was not closed until much later in the day. Other airlines were still flying to the Bandung airport much later in the day.

Christine,"April 27, 2017",Cityjet,5.2,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,0,,,3,No,"Bumped at the gate at Paris CDG en route to Dublin at 6.50am Sunday morning March 25 with bus still at gate , last passengers boarding and doors open. It was a 7.10am flight.  There were huge delays in immigration and security which the staff were fully aware of.  Had to go back thru security, buy 2 new tickets at 400 Euros and then back thru security again, barely in time for the 9.30 flight. We were travelling to an 80th birthday celebration in Dublin and as we are also senior citizens, had stayed the night in an airport hotel so we would be on time.  Similar to the United debacle last week, I now suspect our seats went to staff or standbys.  I guess we should be pleased for small mercies as at least we were not dragged off by the feet or breaten wwith a baby pusher. And guess what, when we got to Dublin at 10.30, there were our two checked-in bags sitting on a dead baggage carousel which I believe is against aviation rules as they should have been removed from the earlier flight. Thanks CityJet for all the inconvenience, expense and distress you caused."
Barbara,"January 22, 2017",Cityjet,5.2,Flew Economy,4.0,2,1,1,0,,,3,No,I take Citiyet on a regular basis. I can’t remember they ever fly on time. You are not allowed to take your handluggage in the airplane. This is understandable since the luggage space is smaller than in other airplanes but they should be transparent about it. Citiyet employees are always stressed.
Tom,"August 3, 2016",Cityjet,5.2,Flew Economy,7.0,4,4,5,0,,,4,No,"Excellent flight crew but limited support for ground agents when flight was cancelled.  Good service, and food, and smooth flight. Convenient to fly from London City."
Nick,"May 1, 2015",Cityjet,5.2,Flew Business,2.0,1,3,2,0,,,1,No,"I flew from London City to Florence and back, business class.   Frankly I was disgusted.   Online check in was difficult and I had to struggle to get through the system – much worse than any other airline I have experienced.   Ground staff were average but on board staff were just not interested.   Moreover, in-flight catering was appalling.   Both breakfast and dinner consisted of a small cardboard box with largely nut based snacks in it.   This was not at all adequate for a business class offering and for anyone with a nut allergy it would have been a disaster."
Karel,"July 27, 2014",Cityjet,5.2,Flew Economy,9.0,5,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"Flew from Avignon to amsterdam, perfect! They serve something to eat and drink for free, on a 1h45m flight. Plenty leg space.

Chris,"February 14, 2013",Cityjet,5.2,Flew Economy,8.0,4,3,3,0,,,1,Yes,"There really is nothing better in life than London City Airport.  Compared to the alternatives half way to Scotland and France, this airport is absolutely da bomb (whoops, not allowed to use that word are we). The seats on Cityjet’s Dorniers are small and perhaps a little less comfortable than the BA alternatives to some destinations (although the price differential is palpable).  I flew to Dundee so there wasn’t that choice anyway.  The only real alternative was to take the train and, well, that wasn’t really an alternative.  Earning Air France / KLM points is an added bonus."
Karin,"August 31, 2023",Condor Flugdienst,3.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Terrible airline. Had mechanical issue. Kept us on tarmac for 3 hours without much information. After three hours they cancelled the flight and we had to wait for another two hours to get our bags back. They put us up in a grotty and dirty hotel one hour from the airport. The food voucher didnt work and they cant get another flight for us until more than 24 hours from our original one. No staff available to help, no one answering the phone. The seats on the plane were tiny and the entertainment system was broken. Will never fly with them again."

Because of a change initiated by the airline of the second leg of the trip I was denied boarding, Condor wouldn’t take responsibility for the whole trip although they GOT PAID for the whole trip. I was told the only way I would be allowed on the plane was to pay for a brand new ticket for my mom and I. In what other industry do you get to keep the customer’s money and demand to be paid again or you would deny them service??? Having lost the connecting flight I was forced to purchase an alternate trip at my own expense. I dealt with nasty customer service person in Germany who accused me of “not making an effort” to solve the situation. I provided a screenshot of the calls to the various airline companies involved – no use. The response they gave FlightHub’s request for refund was that I was not entitled to reimbursement due to “no show”. I provided copy of the airport parking receipt to expose their lie – no use."
Craig,"January 2, 2023",Condor Flugdienst,3.1,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,3,4,2,,1,4,No,"Bottom line, spend the extra money and fly a better airline. I’ve traveled internationally for over 30 years. The service from Condor airline is the worst I’ve experienced . We filed a claim for a refund due to a delayed flight and after 4 months we are still being stonewalled. Our scheduled flight was on Aug. 26 from PDX to FRA Germany. The day of the flight Condor sent an alert that our departure was delayed 24 hours. That meant immediately changing airport transportation,  a connecting flight and 2 hotel reservations. Then almost 1 hour later a second alert was sent that the flight was delayed 2 hours not 24 hours. We had to pay a premium to rebook the connecting flight. What a joke!"
Doru,"July 26, 2022",Condor Flugdienst,3.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"The worst traveling experience in my 40 years on this earth.

Lionel,"March 29, 2022",Condor Flugdienst,3.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Because of an issue on their website. I paid two times for two differents reservations on their website. I tried to call to cancell the second reservation and they ask me praticly the whole price just to cancell the second reservation i made because of their website. So they took my monney twice. So I also contacted them with the form on the website on 15.03.2022 and I’m still waiting an answer. They just ignored me. And I lost a lot of money.

Long story or short I raced to the covid testing station and got the test done as quickly as possible. Condor said my options would be to rebook tomorrow since I would miss the check in window. I was exasperated. The Condor associate said he would check me in without the negative test result done (he would personally do so and then check my test result at the gate). I was AMAZED. I rushed through security and ran to my gate (and within that time ~20 min I thankfully received my negative test result via email which I showed to the person at the gate)."

Totally not worth even €1.Arriving to Munich, When I came to the entrance, the lady told me to show her return ticket. I kindly told her that i live in cancun thats why i dont have a return ticket. She said that i cant fly until i show her a return ticket!She sent me to a guy that was the rudest guy i have ever experienced.He even told me that he sent someone to get out my luggage out of the plane! They made us buy worthless flight tickets that we wont use! I asked for their complete names but  they refused! Its not okay to yell at customers, traveling should be a pleasant time and not stress! I threw away €300. I dont expect anyone from  Condor to even read it but i wanr to help someone not to have stress and throwing away their money.i wont travel with Condor"
Alex,"August 27, 2019",Condor Flugdienst,3.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,3,1,1,3,No,"In 30 yrs of international travel, this experience was the worst by far. Their partner airline bumped me off the second leg of the flight due to overbooking and offered zero compensation on the way there. I mean ZERO: I had to buy a hotel night and paid for a separate flight (with a different airline, obviously). On the way back, they broke my luggage and refused to pay, blaming everyone and their dog but themselves (for what, a $100 at best?!). I mean, they made the whole trip the worst ever and took zero responsibility. Not once throughout the entire debacle did I hear one word of empathy from any of their staff. Shameful, really. Avoid at any cost."
Eliana,"September 10, 2018",Condor Flugdienst,3.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,2,3,1,,,2,No,"The flight and inflight service were mediocre at best. Their customer service is an absolute joke, when I called them about a bag that went missing they were completely useless and couldn’t point me in the direction of anyone that could help me.

Condor took the time to react to my initial complaint, but, compensation afterwards was SWIFT! Thousand things can go wrong with a flight and no one comes to work (Condor staff) with idea to inconvenience few hundred people. Delays happen… Now, how it is dealt with AFTER the fact separates good from average. Condor’s compensation was generous and relatively fast! I’ll use them again!"

Our reservations were mismanaged, the flights were delayed by 18 and 10 hours, the customer service was poor and rude, we were given false information by customer service (which had to be over the phone) ending in the inability to fly with them and losing the cost ($795) of our reservation with them. We had to make other reservations with other airlines at the cost of an extra $1,600 while missing other connections and activities that were pre-planned. I sent in 2 complaints to their complaint department over 3 months and NEVER heard a word back from them."

We spoke with a Copa Airlines desk agent about the possibility of staying in Panama.  She ASSURED US that we could stay the night in Panama City and board our flight from Panama City to Atlanta in the morning.  We did so but were shocked to find that because we didn’t board the flight from Lima to Panama City our tickets from Panama City to Atlanta had been cancelled.  We had been given assurances by Copa representatives in the Quito airport the previous day that this would not happen.  We were forced to pay a $535 penalty fee to re-instate our cancelled tickets to Atlanta."

We are trying to get a refund for the past couple of hours. We having no such luck even though in their own air transportation agreement states 6.7.2. Types of refunds (i) 100% of the value of the ticket will be refunded in the event that the Passenger has not used any portion of his ticket or that the interruption has occurred at an intermediate point of his departure segment and the interruption to his flight is due to an irregular operation such as maintenance or delay of equipment.
Karin,"June 14, 2019",Copa Airlines,4.6,Flew Economy Class,5.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"For over 3 months, I have been trying to get Copa to respond to my emails and web messages regarding my fully paid and confirmed tickets, which I cannot retrieve via their ‘manage your booking’ site. I keep getting error messages, saying that my flights can’t be found. None of their self-help sites work. Their on-line call-center does not work, either.  Copa customer services does not seem to exist.  Only because of the help of a very nice travel agent, who had nothing to do with my on-line booking, did I find out about some flight changes, which possibly prevented me from accessing my booking on-line. Copa did not inform me or got in touch with me after so many attempts to get my problem resolved.  After such bad service, I am not looking forward to my flights. Especially after having read all the 1-out-of-10 ratings, I am wondering, what could go wrong next."

I communicated with Expedia (purchased tickets through them). Expedia had me to send info from hospital detailing the events. Expedia has gone back and forth with Copa for two weeks with no end in mind to issue my refund for the flight. Finally, Expedia asked me to get involved with Copa directly. I have sent emails to Copa because no one will talk to you over the phone dealing with refunds. Every time I call,I am receiving the run-around and no one seems to know what I am speaking of. This is ridiculous. I have never experienced this issue with other airlines. I had an issue with American and within days my refund was in my account. Copa is not big on customer service. They are big on giving you a hassle. Several Expedia reps I’ve spoken with stated the same."
Daniel,"January 12, 2019",Copa Airlines,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,4,2,4,,,5,No,"Last month I returned from a business trip to Colombia flying Copa Airlines & it was the worst experience of my life! When boarding the 2nd sector of my flight from PTY to CLO there was no room for my carry-on bag, so I was forced to leave it at the gate for Copa to check in my bag under the plane. When I got onto the plane, I saw there was plenty of room in the first class overhead bins, and tried to take my bag on the plane, but they still refused to let me take it with me! When I arrived in Colombia, I realized that my passport was still in my carry-on bag, so immigration allowed me to get my bag from the baggage area and then go back to immigration. Unfortunately, Copa Airlines never put my bag onto the plane, and my carry-on bag together with my passport was still back in Panama! Copa Airlines never put my bag on the plane, even though it was on the gangway literally 5 feet away from the plane before take off! Everyone else who had their bags checked in last minute also did not receive their bags. The immigration supervisor would not let me into Colombia, since my passport was back in Panama! I was forced to stay overnight at the airport and was forced to take the next flight at 5am back to Panama! It was like the movie Terminal with Tom Hanks! Even thought I had a hotel booked for that night, I was forced to stay overnight in the departure lounge, and got no sleep all night. I also eat only kosher food, and all my food was in my bag, so I also had nothing to eat. When I arrived the next morning back in Panama, I had 3 hours till the next return flight back to Colombia. After complaining & screaming for over 3 hours to so many people at the Copa airlines customer service desk, they finally found my lost carry-on bag, and I was able to get my passport for the flight back to CLO. Copa Airlines would not let me take my bag with me on the flight, as they claim that my bag was in a secured area. Copa then had to get special permission to allow me to re-enter Colombia, since I was denied entry the first time. After 40 minutes of the airline attempting got make an international call, they finally managed to call Colombia and get permission for me to go back there and legally enter the country. I then flew back to Colombia for the 2nd time, and when I arrived this time I went to collect my suitcase and carry-on, and they lost my bags for the 2nd time!!! Not only did my bags not show up, but there were about 15 other people who’s bags also did not arrive from my flight alone! I had to file a 2nd lost baggage report 2 days in a row!!! Copa airlines then informed me that there are 2 more flights going from PTY to CLO that day, and they would deliver my luggage to my hotel, as soon as it arrives. My luggage never arrived that day, and I finally received it the following evening when I got back to my hotel. The baggage got delivered literally the night before my flight back to the USA. I had no kosher food to eat for my entire stay in Colombia, and was living off fruit and water! I had the expense of the hotel for the 1st night that I was not able to sleep in, and missed half my business meeting in Colombia. It was a terrible experience, and have asked Copa for compensation. Every time I called them, they were just useless, kept me on the phone for ages, and then did nothing to help me. My only recourse was to send them a email, which I did, and I’m now waiting for a response, which I doubt I’ll get! Terrible airline, never fly with them if you want your bags to arrive with you!"

I accepted their offer of payment 12 weeks ago and they stated it would be received in 8-10 weeks. Still no sign of payment and their customer services are not interested in helping. A quick search on Twitter shows I’m not the only one currently in this position with numerous people complaining of similar issues in receiving the compensation they are legally entitled to. They seem to be trying to increase their offering from UK airports this year but can’t even resolve their issues from last year. Regardless of how they cheap they may be it’s not worth risking flying with them. If you do encounter problems and need to contact them (which it seems many have) you will be left frustrated and most likely out of pocket

I was a bit surprised and wanted to check if I could get into my online reservation but did not have access any longer. The booking was not found. This left me with the impression that my booking was cancelled. I booked another flight with another company. After receiving another mail that my flight would start soon, I called and learned that nothing was cancelled. That I supposedly paid double at checkout and that, as honest as they are, they immediately refunded one payment. And that I could cancel the flight to get a € 270 refund The trick cost me € 300"

I had one time a delay (1 hour at Eindhoven). We had no info from Corendon employees. It seems they had no idea, so “no answer”. I consider the quality / price very good. The only real complaint I have is about the space you have in front of your seat. I have no idea how to do if for an urgent reason I have to take the “brace position” ! And I am a large person. This problem seems to be general for national or low cost companies (I think for all countries). Except, of course, when you pay business or first class …."

When I showed the photos to my colleagues later they laughed and said  “no way!” This is outrageous and shows how we need legislation to prevent this type of appalling treatment of customers by a cynical airline management team. The worst seating I have experienced in many decades. The guy in front reclined his seat so I couldn’t even read my magazine, his head was so close to my face. It was not possible to pay for extra legroom as their computers are apparently not compatible with other Star Alliance airlines. I don’t blame the cabin staff, who were excellent! But Never again!

I believe the costs are too high in comparison to BA and many other credible airline companies. Croatia Airlines failed to offer a possibility of paying excess baggage online and reduce the costs, did not offer a possibility of upgrading into a higher flying class to avoid the charges. Additionally, they do not offer online check in and they could only issue me two boarding passes while I have to get the last one in Vienna to London, even though they’re aware that there is a very limited amount of time between the two fights! I’ll do my best to avoid Croatia Airlines in future."
John,"January 8, 2015",Croatia Airlines,6.7,Flew Economy,8.0,4,3,4,0,,,3,Yes,"I fly Croatia Airlines about twice a month for most of the year. Generally, I fly from Amsterdam to Split, mostly by way of Zagreb– their routing, not my preference— although it can often be from Paris to Split, or Rome to Split or Frankfurt to Split. Most of the time, things go well. I have had a few nightmare trips, where everything has gone wrong. This has included extra fees charged, luggage lost, connections missed, etc. Unfortunately, their “customer service” people are not nearly as good as their flight attendants, and other folks on the plane. Being a government owned airline of a former communist country, their customer service on the ground often sucks. Their favorite phrase can be “it is not possible”. So now, after 5 years of flying with them, I generally ask for help by starting with “is it possible?” Often it is not possible, but sometimes an exception can be made in this situation only. They are not the only Croatian industry with customer service problems, but this is where I see it most, and at the most inopportune times. Professional acting and looking in-flight crews, although not always overly friendly, can definitely be great. On a recent trip when we asked for cherry juice as our on-board drink, they gave us one kind, then brought another type for us to try. Later, a flight attendant brought us a full carton, unopened, to take with us. (When there, try the local cherry juice– its great.)"
Tomislav,"January 7, 2015",Croatia Airlines,6.7,Flew Economy,4.0,1,4,3,0,,,1,No,"Flew with Croatian Airlines several times and in general in flight service is quite poor. On longer flights (1:30-2 hrs) you get a dry sandwich with a thick piece of ham inside. However on an early morbibg flight from Zagreb to Vienna no coffe is served. Only a glass of water. The flight attendant was walking the plane with a 1.5 l bottle of water and plastic glasses. No in flight entertainement on amy plane. Just for comparation, return flight by Austrian offer a small bottle of water, a bag of cockies and a coffe."

Chris,"August 8, 2013",Croatia Airlines,6.7,Flew Economy,8.0,4,4,3,0,,,3,Yes,"We flew on a Dash-8 from Zagreb to Rome, via Split. The aircraft was clean and the flight attendants attentive. Departure lounge in Zagreb could do with more seats and a food and beverage outlet (only one coin-operated machine available).  The flight to Split  was fine despite bumpy conditions. In Split you leave the plane, with your hand luggage and walk across the tarmac to the small terminal. Up and down stairs, which would be a problem if you had a disability, or if it was raining. Through personal and baggage security all over again (why can’t luggage be left on the aircraft?) and back onto the aircraft. Snacks, small, served in flight. Seats okay for short ‘regional’ flights. On landing in Rome, we were parked some distance away from the terminal and waited a long time for a bus to transfer us to the terminal – a reflection on Fiumicino inefficiency rather than on the airline.  Would be happy to fly with Croatia again – particularly if attendants could smile now and again."
Fred,"June 16, 2013",Croatia Airlines,6.7,Flew Economy,8.0,4,4,5,4,,,4,Yes,"Amsterdam – Zagreb. The flight deprated on time, only 4-5 minutes delay due the morning rushhour at Amsterdam. The plane, a A319 was looking great, seats in the economy class are the new type that Lufthansa uses 2 that look like racing seats. It’s all good and fair enough. Price for the tickets was not bad 2 and the flight was direct. I dont have no real complains about the airline, both routes went with no problems and nice staff on board."

Kim,"May 1, 2017",Cubana,5.3,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"We had never heard of this airline prior to booking our trip.  When our travel agent assured us that this airline was safe and reliable, we trusted in her expertise.  The day of departure ran smoothly, and the flight was on time.  However, as soon as we stepped on the plane, it was dirty, small, old, and extremely uncomfortable.  Hardly any leg room, and absolutely no in-service entertainment, making our flight to Varadero very unpleasant.  At this point we had decided we are never flying this airline again.  The day of returning back to Toronto, we arrived at the airport at our usual time, 3 hours prior, and the check in process was normal.  We waited for 2 hours for our flight that was scheduled to depart at 8:15pm.  As the time was approaching, we noticed that the plane hadn’t yet arrived, which was odd given that every other plane was arriving at least 1 hour prior to departure.  At roughly 8:45pm, they finally updated the screen at the airport stating our flight delay of 3 hours, making our departure now at 11:05pm.  All passengers were evidently upset, as we were now at the airport for ~5 hours, as we watched roughly 10 flights depart to Toronto (our destination) throughout"

If you are looking for exceptional leg room, great inflight service and an appreciation for your hard earned travel dollars, you may want to consider Cubana.  I admit that I was apprehensive in booking this all inclusive vacation through Hola Sun because their air carrier was Cubana but any apprehension is no more. In addition the plane was clean, the seats were free of any stains or rips and boarding at both Toronto and Cayo Coco was organized and professional. If you do decide to book a flight with Cubana, it really is worth it to get the “club class” upgrade costing $120.00 Canadian per leg.  It was first class fantastic with a very good hot meal, excellent drink service and service beyond compare.  Unfortunately the “club class” is only available for upgrade to at the airport upon check in…not available during pre-booking. If you have already booked with Cubana and read negative reviews about the airline, don’t be concerned.  I am a frequent flyer and I had nothing whatsoever to complain about."

During check-in, I was told by the ground crew I need to pay to send my suitcase, sure enough, I’ve presented the confirmation email which proves my pre-purchase for checked-in luggage but it didn’t convince the check-in staff, and I was asked to pay 45Euro which was unacceptable. The ticket office staff was not helpful either, telling me they are an external company and can’t do anything to help, and I should pay now and write an email to Czech Airlines later and ask for a refund. With no other options, I paid the 45Euro and wrote to Czech Airlines but got no reply and obviously no refund. As for the flight itself, you pay Czech Airlines but actually flying with Smartwings which is a low-cost company with triable service, cramped aeroplane, and sower ground crew. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE! WHAT A SHAME!"
Sara,"July 29, 2019",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I am really displeased with the way Czech Airlines mismanaged my flight today and denied me a seat I had booked and paid for almost a month ago. I had my boarding pass in hand and just before my amazed eyes, I was asked very rudely to step aside while two other passengers were  given way and let on the plane. My calls for help – and later cries of frustration – got nowhere. Instead I was asked to take a flight the next day! I tried to explain that I had to be at work the next day to no avail. The people from your airlines kept me waiting for almost two hours before sending me to the residence next to airport with food vouchers!"
max,"July 20, 2019",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,2,3,1,2,1,3,No,"ordered tickets via Czech airlines, and got smartwings low-cost without notice. customer order not recognized on their own website. no online check-in in 2019 is unacceptable. registration opens only 2 hours before flight, creating huge lines. it’s like they hate their own customers, really. that was the first and definitely last time i’ve flew with this company, all family and friends warned"
Magnus,"April 5, 2019",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,No,"Did pick this company to bring me to Prague, big mistake. It’s extremely small space for legs and sitting area. When it comes to luggage they align with the lowest cost company and charge extra for everything. I had one computer and a small roller bag (small) and wasn’t ok. Need to check in and pay extra. So if you can avoid this company, do so."
Eduardo,"April 28, 2018",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"We traveled by Czech Airlines on April 13, 2018 and had a big disappointment with the company. I would not recommend anyone to travel for it. The flight was packed, at the time of boarding our hand luggage had to go in the luggage compartment (coming back scratched). As our bags were organized we decided not to risk placing these volumes in them for fear of losing or delaying our flight. So far so good, but we were charged an exorbitant amount for carrying a small bag with our passports, tickets and hotel documents, as well as a small backpack almost empty with wrappers in case of cooling during the trip or landing. It was charged more than R $ 400,00 (four hundred reais) or something close to 100 euros, and one of the receipts issued was delivered with the name of another passenger. After paying this amount, our volumes were placed under our feet, as there was no space in the luggage compartments. We traveled by TAP, easyJet and GOL airlines in the same class; in none of them was this charge traveling in the same way with the same volumes. The disgust for disregard and discomfort in paying for something we did not receive was great. I do not advise this company."
Laur,"September 9, 2017",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,,,2,No,"The tickets sold have a check-in like bar code which allowed us to go through the airport security. But when we got to the plane (that was late) the staff denied us access saying that we didn’t check in so they sold our seats to other people. No calling, no warning, nothing has been done to make us even think something was wrong. Instead, the airport staff misled us to the boarding gate. So we got kicked out the boarding room and had to come back the next day. CSA first refused any ticket modification or cancellation. They threatened us to buy new tickets or to loose the flight back (among the rest of the airbnb booking). This is pure scam on every level: 1- There should not be a misleading check-in like bar code on the flight tickets 2- If there has been a problem during the check-in, we should be called in the airport 3- Overbooking flights is just wrong 4- Selling other tickets or threaten to loose the flight back is what scammers do Do not choose this company"

Caitlin,"October 26, 2016",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy,4.0,2,3,1,0,,,0,No,"Flight from Prague to Copenhagen was delayed, which was fine. I was on a deadline but I could still make it at this point. Then, at the gate, the attendants wouldn’t let me take the small suitcase I’d been using as a carry-on on 4 previous flights – one previous with Czech Airlines from Rome to Prague since I had an hour and a half layover in Prague flying from Rome to Copenhagen – onto the plane. They made me pick it up at baggage claim in Copenhagen. Doing this made me late for the train to my final destination which meant I had to wait an extra two hours for a train that would take three hours to arrive. I did not get to my destination until 3 o’clock in the morning because of the gate attendants. They weren’t even polite about what they were doing. I told them that I could take my computer out of the front and that would make it fit, but they stuck a tag on the suitcase and told me that I could take my computer out and bring it on the flight, but that I had to pick my suitcase up in Copenhagen. I did not get the attendants’ names, but I was not impressed by their service."
Cheryl,"October 9, 2016",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy,4.0,3,3,4,2,,,3,No,"We booked this flight online with Ocheapair.com and understood we had a limit of 23kg for our baggage.  Upon check-in we were told we only had 15kg and were forced to pay $175E on the spot.  Personnel was rude and would not work with us on the matter to reduce the cost.  No airline I’ve ever flown has this low of weight limit (even Spirit Air which is a very low cost airline).  Appalling.  The gate changed and no announcement was made until after we inquired, flight was delayed and no announcement was made.  Others were also upset and found staff to be rude.  Will no doubt not use this airline again.  This seemed like a reasonably priced flight but soon became rather expensive.  Not happy at all with this airline."
Louis,"June 24, 2015",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy,1.0,2,3,4,0,,,0,No,"I booked and paid business class on Czech Airlines from Budapest to Prague. At the airport in Budapest we went through the business class line for checkin but when we boarded the plane we discovered it was a prop jet with no business class. In addition, the seating assignments, which naturally did not match those I selected, meant very little in terms of where we sat. I’m not impressed by an airline that sells business class seats in a plane with no business class."
David,"June 8, 2015",Czech Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"Excellent. Far superior to Lufthansa. Very friendly crew, excellent service , and on time departures and arrivals. Destination was Zurich to Prague"

Tara,"July 4, 2023",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"I had booked a flight from Newark to Paris and upon uploading my passport information I found out my tickets had been cancelled. Not through an email or a phone call, but by chance that I checked my flight information. Delta would have been okay having me and my family show up at the airport just to find out that our seats had been taken away from us. Despicable. I sat on the phone for another four hours being transferred from person to person, each less helpful than the last. Turns out they had already sold my seats, out from underneath me, and could not even offer a refund. Not only this, but I am now required to pay another $6,000 to sit in a class of service that was not below the class of service that my previous seats were in. I have WASTED time and money on this repulsive airline and I wish I would have just booked a different one. Now all that I can do is steer clear of Delta, and STRONGLY advise that you do the same. DISGUSTING!!!"
Marja,"May 31, 2023",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew First Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,Yes,"I am incredibly impressed with how Delta Airlines has gone the extra mile for me.  My son couldn’t get in due to weather at Christmas and Delta helped him reschedule for a later date.  Then, just two weeks ago, I had a small problem checking an item that wouldn’t go through TSA.  When I reached out to Delta, they bent over backwards to address my issue (which was really largely my fault).  Today, I received a small “sorry” gift that was completely unexpected.  These are classy people!"
Anne,"April 1, 2023",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew First Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"Great service, great in-flight experience and I’d recommend them every time. Rarely has a flight been delayed more than a couple minutes. Super reliable airline."
Rachel,"March 4, 2023",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I was flying from Buffalo to Myrtle Beach, and my first flight was delayed over an hour due to “mechanical issues” causing me to miss my connecting flight in Detroit by 10-15 minutes, and passengers were not allowed to de-board the plane and opt to stay in Buffalo rather than continue with the flight. Delta would not hold the plane so that I could make the connection. The itinerary had to be changed and now involved me flying 4 flights rather than 2. Again, the 3rd flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight by 10-15 minutes again, and AGAIN Delta was unwilling to hold the plane. I was unable to make it to my destination and had to stay in an airport alone for NYE. I reached out to Delta’s customer service requesting a refund but they refused as the itinerary was already flown and would only offer a voucher for less than half my ticket cost. They would not escalate my complaint to a supervisor despite multiple requests to do so."
Robert,"March 4, 2023",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,Actually Northwest Airlines. I noticed no mention of Northwest Airlines . We were a major user of the 747. Check the nose section of a 747-100 N601US that belonged to Northwest. Its there because it made the first revenue flight to Asia from the US. We were also very involved with Pratt & Whitney in JT-9 mods At the time Donald Nyrop made big news in the airline industry over the companys commitment to the airplane. You mentioned National Airlines because they sold theirs but never mentioned to who. NWA is who. You must have people that are distant from the industry to wtight stories like this
Andrew,"January 6, 2023",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,4,1,4,,3,3,No,"After flying more than 750,000 miles on Delta and maintaining Platinum status for several years I just discovered that paying for a domestic 1st class ticket no longer gets me into the lounge. Delta just removed the one reason I’d prefer to book on Delta. What a way to treat a loyal customer. This is for sure the beginning of the end of leadership for Delta. On my most recent flight from Orlando to Seattle, the toilet door lock was not working. The hostie was rude and told me to hold it shut."
Andrea,"September 9, 2022",Delta Air Lines,3.9,Flew First Class,1.0,0,4,0,0,,,3,Yes,This review is not about the flight but about the airline on-the-ground costumer service. Flight 4952 got delayed and I missed my connection to SLC (flight 1352). Your red coat Rana Abdelhalim accused me of this being “my fault” therefore I was eligible for a hotel voucher. Even one of the other officers present told her the flight came delayed and she argued with her. She was dismissive and sarcastic during the interaction and one one point mocked me because I said it was in inconvenience for me. I went ahead and had to spend $250 in a rental car plus$100 in gasoline and $50 in food/ drinks to drive OVERNIGHT all the way to SLC (800 miles). Delta Airlines needs to improve its employees costumer services skills.

Delta’s station manager in Hartford patiently and kindly helped us do this, trying repeatedly and finally meeting us at the gate to finish the process. It was not easy.  We would not have been able to enter St Lucia without her help.  The whole Delta staff, coming and going to Atlanta and then on to St Lucia on these flights (12/5 and 12/12) were also helpful, courteous, with both flights smooth and on time.  Delta’s advertising as number one in customer satisfaction is not surprising to us!

They were behind curtains the whole time and we had to wait to go to the toilets as it was a small A320-200.  It was a great flight but they need to improve with their service.

I have had to use multiple times due to being the only option on a particular route but every time my flights have been heavily delayed or cancelled. Due to staffing issues but they lie and blame other factors to avoid paying compensation. No support when flights get cancelled, very poor quality airline. Completely unreliable and with flight cancellations, you’ll likely be stuck with no solution and no one to help. Pay a little extra and fly with a different airline or use another airport, it’s worth every penny avoiding. Most recent experience, flight cancelled while at the airport after multiple delays (this is the 3rd time of this happening in the space of a few months) with zero support or help, stuck for days trying to travel."

We told her that one her airline operater confirmed and gave assurance about bo issue on size then why now she is saying this. She was so loud and said she is going to cancel our tickets if we won’t pay. And didn’t realize were with our kid and orderly parents and didn’t listen to us. It’s one of the horrible and bad experience with us. We had to pay around 80 pounds and were totally stressed

Zilong,"March 4, 2023",Easyjet,3.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,2,2,3,1,1,2,Yes,"Terrible service. The price showing on the website is not the amount you pay. You will get charged for your on board suitcase and sit when you purchase the ticket. And pay the same suitcase when you check in online. When I come to the boarding station, the server didn’t allow me to take it on board and asked me to pay it as a checked luggage. However when I took it on board, it perfectly fitted in. Am I getting charged just because of asian looking and having a rimova standard on board suitcase?"

My bag had a measurement of 45x36x20 and I said that in London I was reassured that this bag was alright to take with me on the plane. She answered that staff in London clearly cannot do their job properly and in Portugal they know how to do it. Therefore, she requested me to pay 48euro, which I paid to avoid further conflict. She also put the label on my bag and said I have to put it under the plane. I said I have only this one bag and on my ticket I was allowed to take one bag to 15kg to go under the plane for free so why did I have to pay. She got impatient and in-front of everyone called me a ‘bad customer’ and tried to take bag away from me. When I was about to get on the plane I was stopped by another lady as apparently Portway Casimiro did not board me, only took money."

I bet that I was not the only one who had not time during a stressful working day to read all small letters. on top of that there there was not that much space in the airplane. I recommend to consider an other airline."
Philippe,"July 26, 2022",Easyjet,3.6,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,3,4,1,5,5,1,Yes,"I fly with easyJet most of the time, since they often are the only one with direct flights to my favorite destinations. When booked a few months in advance, they are incredibly cheap, but get quite pricy as time goes buy. Service on board is bare to the bone, but staff are helpful and nice. They have relatively new planes, comfort good enough for short flights. The only drawback is that they often have the worst gates in airports, and you usually have to walk all the way though the airport to get there. But in my opinion, fares are worth the walk."

Roland,"April 13, 2019",Edelweiss,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,2,0,3,3,1,No,"my worst experience ever, and I am flying a lot (far too much). The flight was scheduled to depart Zurich at 16.30h, and I was happy to see there was no departure delay. So we left in time, but after about an hour in the air, the plane returned to Zurich due to technical problems. ok, shit happens. but then the real mess started. after landing in Zurich again, we were waiting for some 3 hours in the airplane. they were looking for some spare parts to repair the airplan, until they finally figured out that there was a spare part, but they did not get clearance to build it in. so we were shipped back to the gate. no information there, just a never ending queue of people. we left and went home, just to get a message finally that we were scheuled for another flight – 48 hours later !!! instead of leaving Friday for the weekend, they scheduled us to leave Sunday evening. what the f…. never ever again Edelweiss."
David,"June 24, 2018",Edelweiss,4.4,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,1,3,3,,,2,No,"A Comprehensive review of SWISS / EDELWEISS Airlines overview of flights between Costa Rica and England via Zurich rated on a scale of 1 – 10 , 1 being Terrible , 10 being excellent . Punctuality. We used four flights on this particular trip with Swiss Air or its share code partners , of which NONE were on time according to the schedule , an average of 1 hour late on all of the flights with NO real explanation given. However it is blatantly obvious that the reason for this is down to bad organization , bad management and planning . Rating 5/10 Quality of Service . We had never flown via Swiss Airlines previously and probably will never do so again as the experience was NOT good , having previously used British Airways , Air France , Iberia ,and Klm we would certainly chose any of these before using Swiss Air the reasons will be mentioned in this report . Our first bad experience was an email request to Swiss Air for assistance about our booking ,we NEVER had a reply to our request even 14 days after it was put in the only reason we ever did get an answer was because I obtained the email directly to Swiss Airs CEO. Swiss Airs customer service is located in Fiji believe it or not and they obviously have zero interest in replying to customer enquiries , probably the worst customer service we have ever seen for a service industry provider . On board the aircraft the service you will receive at best can be described as average you as basically treated as cattle in economy class , probably a little better in economy plus or business . BEWARE OF HIDDEN COSTS . NO free alcoholic beverages in economy class you will be charged for a beer or glass of wine with the SMALL meal you will receive and the average cost is around $10 per drink, all of the other mentioned airlines offer alcoholic beverages as a courtesy to their customers. Rating 3/10. Comfort on Board and hidden extra expense in Economy Class . BE WARNED for a long haul flight the seating setup is probably the most uncomfortable we have ever experienced on any long haul carrier . The seats are much smaller than other airlines we have used in the past , the seats are very tight and small little of no room to move and we are only small bodied people 1.64 and around 70kgs . The seats are only just big enough to sit in , very very close together I would estimate around 5cm space between your knees and the rear of the seat in front of you I.E. zero leg room very tight fit . Your seat will only recline around 8cm therefore you are basically upright , however when the person in front of you reclines their seat you will be boxed in no room to move . To be able to consume the small average quality meal you will receive no choice offered ( usually you will get 2 options but not here ) you will be expected to perform a contortion act to be able to consume your food . Although the aircraft are new and clean the comfort level in economy class is extremely bad and we would not recommend it . Rating 3/10 Hidden Extra Costs Involved using Swiss . BE WARE . If your baggage is just slightly overweight 23kgs max you will be charged an excess baggage fee of approximately $200 per suitcase , most other airlines make allowances for a little extra weight on long haul flights NOT Swiss . Also as previously mentioned only soft drinks are free in economy class , a beer or glass of wine with your meal will cost on average $10 each . Because of the terrible seating configuration in economy class you will be offered the chance to upgrade to economy plus or business , the average cost for economy plus is $120 per person , business a little over $400 per person , it appears the configuration is set this way to obligate larger framed people to pay the extra cost to up grade . This would then mean that you make no real saving on Swiss Airlines slightly cheaper fares as in the end you will end up paying the same price as other carriers who offer a better more comfortable service with no extra cost and whom are on schedule , please take these hidden extras into consideration before booking Swiss Air . Also note that on board all though being a flight originating from a Spanish speaking area NO instruction’s on board are given in Spanish if you do not speak German or English you will have no understanding of what is being said over the on board speakers I would consider this dangerous and maybe even illegal when coming down to safety instructions . Rating 3/10 Overall Experience . We would strongly suggest using any other carrier option rather than Swiss Air , as the service you will get is well below that of other carriers available to you . Not something you would expect from the Swiss as usually their service and quality is of the very best and high standard however not the case with this airline . Recommendation GIVE SWISS/Edelweiss A MISS ."

I was aware of having to pay for drinks in economy, it didn’t bother me. I actually got an upgrade to Premium Economy on the outbound leg, didn’t even realise it until I was about halfway through the flight. A bit more legroom, that’s the only difference.  Only strange thing was that on the way out we got the usual little packs with socks, eye mask, toothbrush etc, although this was a flight completely in the daytime, and nothing on the night flight on the way back."

Eva,"August 30, 2014",Edelweiss,4.4,Flew Premium Economy,2.0,2,3,1,3,,,2,No,"My flight from Las Vegas to Zurich in July 2014 was completely inacceptable. We had to wait for almost 4 hours on the tarmack due to technical problems with the fuel system (without the airconditioning working properly). The crew seemed absolutely out of their depth. When the flight was finally postphoned to the next day, it took hours for them to get us into hotels. We were not given the information sheets on passengers’ rights and no food/drinks/possibility to make phone calls were provided. The flight on the next day was delayed again. The flight itself was average, with service below standard. Despite the really expensive tickets, alcohol is not included. I am well aware that technical problems can occure with any airline, but the difference in quality is seen by the way the airline in question handles the situation. So I would really avoid flying edelweiss again because of their appalling costumer service."

EgyptAir security officers were very rude to the passengers they offended most of them throwing away their small bottles of hand sanitizers although it was less than 3 Oz internationally approved size , mainly they do not know how to communicate nicely , they made most of the passengers comment negatively about using EgyptAir in the future “I asked them about their employer and they confirmed EgyptAir” , food was not as expected, over all  the trip doesn’t worth the money paid for compared to other airlines working on the same route ."

We were four girls from jerusalem on our way back to home from Georgia. It took us from 7:30 till 12:00 for unbelievable checking. They checked every single piece of us and also our bags and in the end the took my personal phone and didn’t allowed to enter the flight with the phone without any reason .

Ben-Gurion Airport (Tel Aviv, Israel), for my son. His age is 2 years 10 months The reason for the refusal was that my son did not have permission to enter Israel from Russia. The El Al agent justified his refusal to register with the orders of the Population and Immigration Authority, which he received by text message. But in all the rules it was written and is now written that no permission is required. We could not prove our right to return the child to Israel due to the fact that agent EL AL called the police to put pressure on us. El Al’s actions violate my family’s rights. We incurred large unplanned financial expenses. We were under a lot of stress, including the fact that El Al’s agent called the Russian police. My wife and our youngest son had to return to Israel. For a young child who had never been away from his mother for more than 8 hours, it was a lot of stress."

Steve,"November 6, 2018",El Al Israel Airlines,5.0,Flew Business Class,9.0,4,5,5,5,,,4,Yes,"Flew El Al from LAX to TLV, connecting from Seattle. I was traveling with lots of luggage, and a pet cat. Pluses: All luggage except for the said, cat, was sent directly from SEA -> TLV without my need to check out the bags, and schlep to another terminal. Despite the fact that I flew on two separate tickets, AS and LY have a luggage agreement, NICE! The sleeper seats were great and needed on this 14-hour flight. The flight crew, were awesome, pleasant, and the food was good, and since it was El Al, plentiful. The entertainment system was really good, but not heavily used because 1) I slept, 2) You fly with Israelis… you talk! The minuses: Ground staff in LAX, TERRIBLE!!!!! Nasty, and NOT helpful. No good mechanism to let me know that kitty was indeed, on board (AS has a great system). I had to continuously annoy the purser until the pilot (who was totally awesome) came back to let me know that my cat was indeed, loaded. And finally. These seats are not very private, and the poor folks who travel in the middle, the 2 – 3 – 2 configuration for business, is not optimal. Most decent airlines do 2 – 2 – 2, a MUCH better configuration, also a herringbone setup would also be better."
Bernard,"September 4, 2018",El Al Israel Airlines,5.0,Flew Business Class,5.0,2,4,3,4,,,2,No,"EL AL DREAMLINER BUSINESS CLASS – FAR FROM THE BUSINESS CLASS DREAM! Business class on El Al’s new Dreamliner has very comfortable seats but a total lack of business class attributes beyond that. It starts with little things like the magazines (nothing in English available). Champagne is only available before takeoff if one specifically asks for it, and then it takes an age to arrive. No wine list is available (there used to be on El Al before the Dreamliner); the flight attendant is not entirely sure what is availableNuts are served in hard to open plastic bags, not the elegant little dishes one sees on most top class business flights. The meal itself was like eating in a college cafeteria. All the courses were served at once on a single small tray, the bread perched on top of the entrée and doused in the gravy. The menu says specifically that one can ask for the main course to be served later in the meal. The flight attendant reluctantly agreed to this request but kept us on the fast track by serving us the rest of the meal before the other passengers. There seems to be a distinct focus on getting the meal done as quickly as possible. What’s the hurry? Food was edible but far from business class standard – upper class college cafeteria fare at best. Desserts very limited and no liquers or brandy (as there used to be on El Al Business Class). And forget about snacks and treats between meals like on many airlines. And refills of wine – not in El Al Business unless you repeatedly press your bell and ask for it. Exceptionally irritating is that the front business class toilet is off limits to business class passengers. It is reserved for the crew. Why have a business class toilet if it is off limits to business class passengers? The rest of us plebes who paid business class prices need to use premium economy toilets. Something off about that! This is not what business class should be. Other than the reasonably comfortable seats there is little to justify the inflated prices. The accent on getting the food service done as fast as possible is infuriating. If there are passengers who want to get to sleep quickly, there should be an express option for them as there is on many airlines. For the rest of us who have 10 or more hours to kill, El Al should provide true business class service in return for the truly business class prices they charge."

I paid so much for this flight yet I had the most miserable 10 hours of my life. I sat in the middle seat with no light above me,  no space for my arm, no space for my leg, and the most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat on. I thought my butt crack after sitting on that for that long. It would be more adorable if the flight attendants were kinder and more patient, but they were the rudest ones I have ever met. I pushed the help button on my seat like six times over the flight for water because the woman sitting next to me was old and asleep  but not one flight attendant ever came to my help. I was thirsty and hungry the entire flight. The TVs will worst qualities than what we had in 1950. It’s just so appalling how expensive the tickets are but how poor the experience is"
TF,"January 7, 2024",Emirates,5.2,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,2,2,3,3,1,2,No,"I’ve been flying Emirates for many years, being their gold member. But based on the latest flight, i am probably not going to fly them again. First, i wanted to use hundreds of thousands of miles to upgrade myself and my partner to business class, but was told it was not possible as the route was not open for such upgrades, so ended wasting years of miles collections on few hundreds dollars “discount” on economy ticket. Emirates used to be amazing with onboard services and refreshments, but every time i fly it is getting worse and worse (or less and less) with lots of items being out of stock (one hour into the flight). Check-in experience in dubai in the gold members counter was terrible, unfriendly, unhelpful. We spent good 30 minutes discussing umbrella that came on another emirates flight (still having emirates tag on it) and if the checkin person can accept it to the flight or not. Overall, emirates is declining year over year, what once used to be absolutely amazing experience is now almost comparable to low-cost. The only good thing is their entertainment system (if it works for the seat)."

Luca,"July 18, 2023",Emirates,5.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"My last trip with Emirates was deeply disappointing, raising concerns about their commitment to customer satisfaction and safety. I encountered several issues that left me deeply dissatisfied and frustrated. Firstly, I received misleading information from three representatives about their cancellation policy. They assured me I could get a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours but failed to mention it applied only after 7 days. Attempting to cancel, I could only reschedule, resulting in a $500 loss. Despite Emirates acknowledging their mistake, they refused a price match or refund and eventually even stopped responding to my messages. During the flight, we saw blankets piled in front of emergency exits to save time, compromising passenger safety during an evacuation. Emirates declined to reimburse me for damaged luggage, reflecting a lack of care for passengers’ belongings. The return flight experienced an extensive delay due to a missing document, leaving us seated for over two hours without updates or assistance. The stark contrast between Business and Economy class experiences is disheartening. In conclusion, my trip with Emirates fell totally short of my expectations. Misleading policies, unresponsiveness, safety concerns, and inadequate customer care paint a very negative picture."

I was offered a packet of chips as a replacement . When I got to lisbon I wrote a complaint. I finally received a response from customer service over 2 weeks later just when I was leaving Lisbon. The response was, join our frequent flyer program and we will give you 20000 points (around $200 value) to use on a future flight. Not only was I disgusted to be served a cockroach but I am shocked and insulted that Emirates see this as an opportunity to recruit a new FF and only offer compensation that requires me to spend $$$$$ with them."

He closed the system in front of me and refused to take my boarding pass.

Took a flight (connection via dubai) to Colombo, they delayed and made us run for our next flight and the inconsiderate/incompetent pilots/staff couldn’t even apologise and the useless staff are telling us to hurry up?!!!! Ffs the cheek of these people. Gets worse, on the way back the incompetent useless beings got us delayed AGAIN!!!! and this time we missed the connecting flight!!!! So have to wait for the next flight and they give us a rubbish coupon for a free meal to places i dont even eat from!!!! Cheap company, budget airlines! I will never use them again!"

We paid R16900 for returnable tickets and was only refunded R685. The complaints were not even looked at for the delay we had at Manchester airport, then missed our flights at Dubai due to their delay, then booked in at a stinky airport hotel for a flight the next morning. Told us our expenses will be covered, but couldn’t even get a glass of water so had to buy refreshments out of our own pockets. We never received our baggage as promised by the airport and was left with no chronic medication and no clean clothes. At the airport, due to their handling we were told to re-wrap our luggage, things that were bought at Manchester airport, sealed, scanned for and with receipts, were confiscated as we were never informed that we cannot leave the airport with it. Now we request a full refund on our return tickets and are told that they don’t refund because we already used part of the ticket"

The business class lounge at Mascot was immaculate. Both flights were amazingly comfortable and the in-flight staff were highly professional, polite, and helpful. The in-flight services were first rate as were the meals and refreshments. For the return flight, the Air NZ lounge in Christchurch was available and this was also very cosy although not as opulent as the Emirates lounge in Sydney. All over, a very pleasant experience."

After spending $10,000 on business class tickets to attend a family wedding and $500 for their credit card, I saw that I could transfer my miles from my Capitol one card to Emirates and use it to book hotels. So I saved my points for the past 8 months and tranferred 150,000 points ($1500 value) to Emirates family skywood account However when I went to book the hotel Im not told that those transferred points cannot be used to book hotels only toward tickets. Well I dont need tickets, I need a hotel for this wedding and Im now out those points . This is a ripoff of the consumer , as they lure you in to make you transfer your miles and then you cant do anything with them!!! I will never book on this airlines again and I will close my credit card when I return from this vacation that I cannot get a hotel for as they have stolen my points."

Both ways the flight crew was rude and unhelpful, bordering on lazy. The biggest problem was with the toilets, one was out of order for both trips. We stopped to refuel in Bangkok and the entire time on the ground passengers were refused entry to the toilets. The food was mediocre and on the return flight we were too late for our connecting flight to Taiwan, which we learned is a common occurance.

The cabin crew disposed of my new Invisalign trays, which meant I lost out on five days of treatment. The hotel I stayed at during my overnight transit was below standard, and I broke out in spots as a result of spending time there. Upon arriving at Kinshasa NDJILI airport, one of my checked bags did not arrive and it took 10 days for it to be returned to me – and when it did, my luggage was broken into, with the lock removed and screws left exposed. The only missing item was a jewellery case with vintage Chanel jewellery, including a pair of gold Chanel dangle earrings that my late Aunt gave me. I was heartbroken and deeply saddened by the entire ordeal."

We were given credits for 2 different flights. When I tried using these credits the problems started. Dealing with Ethiopian Reservations is a streesful exercise. Ringing is totally stressful. An agent answers and then I would start my explanation and they would cut me off. Emailing is slightly better but I would have to send the same information several times before I got anyone to do anything. Finally I booked our flights. Two weeks before we were due to fly they canceled one of the bookings and said we would have to change the dates. After much stress with emails and calls I finally sorted it out . We were told we could use our excess credit for an upgrade. But, when we tried to do this they refused. So in effect they stole 224 pounds from us. The flights were OK. Staff not so helpful or friendly.  The food was disgusting and the mains were inedible. AVOID Ethiopian if you can."

First, the cabin crew was terrible: no sense of hygiene, mixing old pillows with new ones, empty cups on the floor etc. Then the hotel…where do I start: cold food on arrival, no working shower and hot water (they offered to bring bucket of hot water instead!!). They brought maintenance guy who changed the shower but hot water still not existent. In the morning, still no hot water. Then we realised the airline gave the wrong pick up time to the hotel; luckily we discovered in time so had an extra 2 hours sleep (one of which wasted on maintenance). Breakfast: cold rice, cold chips, overcooked and cold scrambled eggs, cold veg, supermarket bought dry cake (one of which had clearly been stored with chicken as there was sauce on it, so no food hygiene). The worst experience ever!!!"

All I wanted was to bring him during his two weeks of vacation at school in Brazil to spend here in Bangkok, where I live, but his flight has been a nightmare… Because of more than 10 hours of delay on his first flight plus more than one day on his second flight we lost a booking in a hotel, a flight ticket to go on a trip here in Thailand, and without mention the days off that I requested at work to spend with my son who now is in a hotel in somewhere in Ethiopia because of Ethiopia’s delay on his flights. And he is underage what makes me feel super worried about this situation. They even didn’t send me an e-mail about all these changes in Ethiopia and I had written when I booked the flight that I was requesting extra attention on him as he is underage. I’ve been trying to reach the company by phone several times but unsuccessfully. Their customer support for phone calls is terrible. I really don’t recommend this flight company. It’s cheaper?! Yes, it is. But definitely not worthy! Thanks for reading!"

However, when I wanted to change the date of my return flight, I was surprised: instead of $30, they charged me $700 euros. Explanations about “fare rules” left a lot of questions. Even the support couldn’t clearly say where the fee comes from. All they said was “the website calculates it like this”. Unexpected fees and lack of clarity is something you don’t expect from business class. I recommend weighing your choices before flying business with Etihad."

Etihad told us that this is a normal practice of the company to take the amount out of customers’ accounts twice, and to return it some time later. It took weeks to get it back. We later had to cancel our holiday due to a medical reason, but were told that being diagnosed with cancer and starting chemotherapy was not a valid reason for a refund and refused to give us a refund! We were then subjected to being given the “run-around” on phone calls. We were given incorrect information, told that the information we had previously provided was not logged in their system anywhere, promised that they were processing the refund – and then told in the next call that nothing has been done to address our refund. After about 2 months of lies, frustration and shoddy customer service we were finally refunded. This company’s policies and treatment of customers is a disgrace. Added to that, their seats on long haul international flights are tiny. I will never fly with Etihad again. Absolute disgrace!!"

The major issues arise when they stuff up though. Etihad had a 2 day schedule change and they refused to accommodate us on a different airline so we had to change our itinerary in the end, in that process they downgraded me from business to economy, initially promising that they would sort it out. It took them 2 months and about 15 calls from my side for someone to try and do something about it, and it was all empty promises in the end. Each time I called I was asked to pay for the changes that would fit me now that u had to change my itinerary due to Etihad’s fault. It’s been now 6 months and I’m still waiting for the reimbursement from the downgrade, despite additional 10 calls and approaching the Etihad guest via mail. Either their system is so clunky and badly designed and/or the customer service is often so clueless and doesn’t care much at all. The check-in staff outside UAE often doesn’t know many of Etihad’s policies."

The fare showed 1100 USD on the window before she confirmed the payment details but later she was charged an amount of 3979 USD. When we called Etihad’s at +18669481081,  the agent told us that we couldn’t do anything about it now. I am extremely disappointed that a simple billing error couldn’t be resolved on the call. So on three separate occasions, I got onto the call center number used for Canada. Each time I could find nobody able to help. I was told by one operator to call Etihad in Abu Dhabi which I did. “No sorry there is nothing we can do we don’t deal with this kind of situation in this department, but you can use the feedback feature on the website or email travel bank directly”. and it goes on.

Firstly, they charged me USD$65 for a checked baggage on a short distance flight in spite of their website saying “from USD$13.50”. I bought it online, not at the airport. The second problem I had with them was, that they left me at Bariloche airport saying that my ticket has been cancelled in spite of me having my boarding card on my phone! I paid for a checked baggage too and it’s all gone. I had to buy another ticked for a late flight and I lost my hotel reservation I had for that night in Buenos Aires.

I sent through the required information, only to get one last slap in the face from this joke of an airline. Their response read “We are sorry for previous email we must respectfully inform you that current European regulations are not applicable to the routing travelled.”, this after initially receiving a contradictory email which said the opposite – “In accordance with applicable EU regulations, we would like to offer you compensation in the amount of…” I am not sure where to take this further as their customer relations department have lacked proper explanations and are extremely contradictory.

The delay was more than 3h. I sent an email on the 10.7 to Eurowings asking for compensation and they replied on 22.3 which is almost 8 months old. This is absolutely disgusting and appalling. In Cologne, they offered no refreshments or voucher or accommodation as they are obliged by law.

After all the other passengers boarded in the plane, he demanded that I pay a penalty of 70 euros for my hand luggage – a normal sized backpack. I received an email from Eurowings before the flight stating that hand luggage is allowed at no extra cost: “Dear passenger, your Eurowings flight is heavily booked today. To help us depart on time, please hand in your hand luggage at the check-in counter! This service is free of charge for you.” Confused by his request, I tried to show the email to him, but he threatened that he would call the police if I try to argue with him any more.

I asked for the Asian meal, she said she ran out in her cart and if I don’t choose the Western mean, she would need to go all the way to get it. I politely said I’d appreciate it. She rolled her eyes, finally got the meal, and dropped it on my table with an attitude. My wife and I looked at her in shock, speechless. She just walked away. Then, one of our bags got damaged by EVA. We went back-and-forth with EVA bag damage claim, got nickel and dimed, finally received only half the value ($100) of the bag. When our bag got damaged by United Airlines, they replaced it with one of same value and size. We will never use EVA again, and would not recommend EVA to anyone.

I would expect to be able to do this on their website, but apparently since my ticket involves multi-city (rather than round-trip), the change requires to be done via Customer non-service. This is very sad as I’ve flown Eva from SFO to southeast Asia often for about 15 years and have generally enjoyed the comfort and level on onboard service. However, this issue has so turned me off from Eva that I probably will look to Singapore Air or another carrier for future travel – even recognizing using Singapore will add to my time in the air."

EVA cancelled it and I would greatly appreciate my refund as it is way overdue. Below was your message to me ….
Donny,"January 16, 2020",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,Yes,We’ve flown EVA for many years. Every year I’m unable to logon. I copy/paste my logon details every year and they never work. EVA has the worst IT department. Customer service is unavailable to fix it. EVA should be ashamed. Read reviews for the EVA’s phone app. Awful! I tried to  logon this year & got a message that 2 accounts use my same info. The same logon info worked last year. I never created a new account. They blocked me from trying to fix the issue online and require me to contact customer service. But customer service closes at 5:30 PM. I called the desk at my local international airport. They told me to call Reservations – which was closed. There’s no way an international airline should be unable to fix their own IT deficiency for their customer at any hour of the day or night. I just wanted to confirm my flight and check-in online as they encourage. They now charge $80 for my wife to sit with me.  The short leg is a $20 rip off too. We used to select our seats when we bought our tickets every year. EVA Air should be embarrassed.

Vlad,"August 9, 2018",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,3,1,3,,,3,No,"Worst policy about Credit Card. I bought tickets for my daughter using my credit card so she can get from Japan to Canada. She almost missed the flight because they didn’t want to let her on the plane because she could not present the card. They claimed that it is for the security and fraud prevention. The tickets were purchased 4 months before flight and if there was any fraud, it should be discovered by now. I fly a few times a year with dozens of different air companies all over the world. This is a first time we got across of this stupid policy. Even if you bought the ticket for yourself, many things can happen to your original card, like canceled or replaced or expired. So you would have the same issue, because you would not be able to present the original credit card."
Yirong,"October 26, 2017",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"I took a flight from Indiana to New York JFK in order to take international flight from Eva Airways, but due to the connecting flight delay, and wasn’t able to catch Eva flight. There was no one there at Eva ticket counter by the time when I got there but it was only afternoon. I waited at JFK for 11 hours and eventually there are couple reps from Eva showed up at ticket counter, since I was so exhausted for having myself got up to take early morning connecting flight, and just in order to catch up Eva flight, though there won’t be any additional charge since it was considered reasonable due to my last flight delay, but according to what they told that there will be $103 to switching to next flight no matter what, and I took my efforts to explained to them about the reason, but they still insisted charging me for additional fee regarding this incident. So I decided to call Eva customer service to see if they can help with this issue, but I was so disappointed since the rep on the phone declined to help me no matter how hard I’d tried to explained to them my situation to see if there will be a one-time courtesy wavier about this incident, but the outcome was even worse, the rep raised her voice and was being very rude, declined to help me again, and I was despaired with frustration for my first time taking international flight via Eva Airways. I would never anyone to take any international flight via Eva Airways."

I  want to file a formal complain just don’t know where.help,"
J,"August 16, 2017",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,"I purchased a round trip ticket from Toronto, Canada to Manila, Philippines. It was my first time with Eva Air and I was expecting something similar or better than the airline that I am used to which is Korean Air.  To my dismay, starting in Pearson International Airport, the ground crew who assisted me for my check in was not friendly at all. No good evening or hello and doesnt even smile. They were so strict with the weight of my luggage that I paid extra for it which is I understand but when they also weight my purse and put a tagged on it, it was ridiculous. Korean Air dont do that. So meaning, while waiting for your flight and walk around, you have your purse tagged with their airline name. Flight time— Cabin crews were not friendly as expected. One of the crews assisted a passenger next to me for her seatbelt and the crew just lean infront of me without saying ‘EXCUSE ME’. I just let it passed. When we almost fly, they did their final check for the luggage in the overhead bins and since it was a bit higher, the stewardess has to step on the side of my seat without saying ‘EXCUSE ME’ again. Food was horrible and the only snack available is a sandwich."

Laura,"July 10, 2017",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,2,3,1,4,,,3,No,"The customer service from this airline in Japan, specifically Okinawa is absolutely terrible. My husband and I had a shocking experience at the Naha airport. We did not travel together and were told that due to the airline’s credit card policy, my husband would have to re-purchase his ticket with a different credit card than the one I originally used, at the time of check-in. He was never given that option however and simply told too bad he would not be able to make his flight and we would not get a refund because he could not present the card the tickets were purchased with (because I had it with me and had flown a few weeks prior)."
Ron,"July 10, 2017",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy,10.0,4,3,5,5,,,3,Yes,"I have flown EVA many times and have always had very good, attentive service from the entire staff."
ramdee,"June 23, 2017",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Premium Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,Very comfortable seats. Nice flight attendants. And very satisfying food.Lots of variety of entertainment to keep you occupied in a long flight.  The most part that i love about my trip is the unlimited amount of food that they can give you. I have a connecting flight going to the phillippines and both airplanes are satisfying … and in january im flying with them again keep up the great job…
Pinpach,"May 28, 2017",Eva Air,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,2,3,1,4,,,4,No,I just got in to the plane and realized I forgot my shopping bag on the seat in front of the entrance. I wanted to go out and get my bag but the flight attendance said I cannot go out. I asked the flight attendance to check it for me. And the guy with the walkie talkie said he will check for me… after a while I asked them then they said they couldn’t find… someone took it! So I texted my friend who coincidently has a 20mins later departure flight to a different country but we were in the same waiting area … he saw the bag and kept it for me. So that flight attendant didn’t really look for the bag at all… I was wondering if the bag has more value… will they help look for it? Bad experience! Also the flight attendance was not helpful…
Mukesh,"March 4, 2023",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,2.0,3,3,5,4,1,3,3,No,"I had a connecting flight from Auckland to Fiji to Singapore to New Delhi.. fiji airways until Singapore then Air India as last flight. We read some reviews regarding baggage being delayed or not boarded at all. To our worst fear exact same thing happened to me and my travel mate. We reached upto Singapore and our Smart Tags showed baggage location as Auckland terminal. We finally reached New Delhi and its been 20 hrs since, it’s location is stuck at Nadi, Fiji international airport transit terminal. We are helpless with lots of important items in baggage, which is making our lives tough. The most we can get in compensation is 1000 nzd each passenger if at all it’s lost or can’t be delivered. Our items are worth much more. This is leaving bitter taste. I’ll will strongly not recommend anyone if baggage is important to them."
Sarah,"March 4, 2023",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,Yes,"Being a loyal Virgin Australia passenger I found myself stranded in LA and unable to get back to Melbourne. I flew Fiji Airways in February 2021 and Air New Zealand in November. I can say without a doubt my flight with Fiji Airways was far more comfortable in every way compared to air New Zealand. From the comfort of the seats to the incredible vegetarian food there was no comparison. I honestly find the flight crew so delightful, although I have great admiration for all flight crews there was a warmth from all on both flights each way that made it just that was just a little more welcoming. Although Nadi airport leaves a little to be desired my short layover makes it bearable. I’m flying again next month and I didn’t even look at prices (although I wasn’t aware Virgin was flying to LA again) I still think I’d choose Fiji Airways"
Talia,"November 5, 2022",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,1,2,1,4,1,No,Fiji Airways just got 5 star award from APEX. How on earth did that happen? They are not 5 star! They fired 400+ of their very own cabin crew with nothing left to their names. They were not made redundant they were all terminated. Did Apex even take the Airline major debt into consideration before giving away such a rating??
James,"September 19, 2022",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,3,1,3,1,1,2,No,"Flyer beware.  I checked my bags through to my final destination, but the airline required me to remove my bags in Fiij, so they can charge an extra set of baggage fees for the next leg of the trip.  And their baggage fees are large.  They may appear to be a least expensive option, but in the end, they can cost more than other airlines.  They also lost my bags for some time and only produced them when pressed."
Greg,"March 20, 2022",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,Have been waiting several months for a refund and I have been told the wait is approx 12 months. Disgusting that they are not refunding cancelled flights in a timely manner. Fiji Airways is majority owned by the Fiji government with Qantas being the other shareholders. I will never travel to FIJI and am telling my story to whoever will listen.
Tessa,"February 8, 2022",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,Yes,Gaby Sarni and Maria were super helpful and kind before our flight helping us with our seats and arrangements. They also work very quickly and efficiently.
FIONA,"June 8, 2021",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,THIEVES!!  Liars!  Both Priceline and FIJI airlines have no right to be selling these tickets to FIJI – they are GHOST flights -they don’t even fly to Melbourne Australia.  DO NOT BOOK A TICKET with them!  DO NOT deal with them!  FIJI airlines cannot fly to Melbourne – COVID has ravaged their country and there are no flights out of FIJI – i just lost $564 booking a ticket and have no chance of getting the money back.
Christian,"March 7, 2020",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,Never book with Fiji Airways. Their gate agent in Los Angelas denied me boarding and stranded me at LAX (en route from Toronto to Auckland) and did not cancel my flight so that I could rebook using the remaining flight credit. The reason I was denied boarding is that I was unable to show her my onward travel from New Zealand in the 10 minutes I had left in boarding time.
Shivandhana,"January 22, 2020",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Lets just say Fiji Airways is most pathetic air carrier and staffs think their own the planes.Travelled from Nadi to Sydney  in mid January ground staff were rude.. Clearly we could see that everyone was getting checked in but everytime we approached we got told that its not open had to wait for that gentlemen to move away before we could get checked in by one of the staff then comes the flight service where we got told that food is not available as per my dietary requirement as the crews never loaded them and when told them that this is ridiculous as we have health issues we got told we can get arrested as the ridiculous is a level 1 threat.. Will I ever travel on Fiji airways nope will I recommend to friends and families never.its all about money making business..
Nuno,"October 15, 2019",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,2,3,1,3,No,"Flying from Nadi to Christchurch. At the check-in counter the company asked for the “ticket out of New Zealand”, witch I promptly show. It was a ticket from Auckland to Santiago (Chile). The agency from I’ve bought the ticket didn’t sent the “booking reference” of the flight, but I had the booking flight proof and the receipt of payment. Fiji Airways refuse to check me in because I didn’t have the “booking reference” (for a flight 3 weeks later out of NZ). Worst, they didn’t even offer to help or sugest any solution, just saying I had 20min until they close the check-in, refusing to call NZ immigration services to expose the problem. It was night time in Europe, and after 20min and more than 60 Euros on the phone I got the mighty “booking reference”! Arriving in New Zealand, 99% sure, they made me for that spend 1h in Customs running through all my things during an extensive interrogation. It makes no sense playing with people lifes in a job that you are supposed to help people that paid for a service. Worst flying company I ever travelled."
Levi,"February 27, 2019",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,I would never take Fiji Airways again after the experience I had today. I was checked in the night before and had no carry on luggage. I arrived to the airport 1 hour before the flight and the customer service rep refused to let me on the flight since I wasn’t there early enough. This ended up costing us $500 and making us arrive late to our vacation.
Eileen,"February 15, 2019",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Business Class,1.0,3,4,1,0,1,4,3,No,Terrible customer service.  Lost luggage for 4 days on one flight. Compensation was $50 US each.  The next flight we were booked full fare business class from Nadi to San Francisco. The day of the flight it was cancelled due to “reschedule planning”. I believe it was because they did not have enough passengers. We were delayed for 2 days and only offered travel coupons for a future Fiji Airways flight. They did not compensate us for any of the additional expenses for accommodations or food for the additional 2 days.
Martin,"September 30, 2018",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,3,4,3,,,3,No,"I’ve flown with Fiji Airways a few times for work, and found the service and food offering a bit below what one would expect for a full service airline in the region. The food was ok, but the small touches e.g. warming up the bread rolls were missing. My largest concern was the safety culture. I’ve flown on an A330 of theirs twice, a year apart, where the seatbelt light was not illuminated during landing. It would appear to be an aircraft fault, but I can’t understand why it was still there a year later. Also when travelling on a DHC-6,"
John,"March 6, 2018",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Business Class,9.0,4,4,5,4,,,3,Yes,"This Airline has received a bad rap of late. But all I can say is it’s up there will the top 20%. Ok, it’s not an Emirates or even a Qantas, but it’s not bad. We flew business class from Sydney to Nadi return. The seats were not lie flat, but comfy. the Food was OK, not spectacular. The people were fanastic though. Great service!!! And try the new lounge in Nadi!!!!! Way better than anything I have visited with Qantas. Please check out my YouTube experience of the flight. https://youtu.be/wzMuMqLTw2Y"
Angelina,"November 21, 2017",Fiji Airways,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"My elderly parents traveled with Fiji Airways on 12/11/17 and due to the airline overbooked passengers they changed my elderly parents flight to Brisbane to Sydney and failed to explained my elderly parents that they have to go from International airport to Domestic and carry their suitcase themselves. A cousin of mine who noticed my parents flight was changed and went to request Fiji Airways staff to get them back on their initial flight as they are elderly and have got health concerns and not fair for them to be in such situation. My cousin requested airline to provide wheelchair service to both my parents which was stamped on their boarding pass. As my parents were getting off the flight, they approached the air hostess who asked them to “keep walking” and no wheelchair service was provided. Then my parents got lost at Sydney airport and missed their flight to Brisbane as they are elderly- late 70’s and early 70’s and slow at walking. Me and my family were waiting at Brisbane airport for 3hrs and then rang Fiji Airways who mentioned that my parents changed their flight – which was a total lie, my parents were forced to change their flights by the airline staff at Nadi Fiji and airline staff failed to notify Next of Kin. Fiji Airways neglected 2 elderly passengers- age and health, failed their duty of care, and gave incorrect advice to elderly passengers and failed to provide service that they promised. My parents bought their airline ticket on 24/7/17 and they paid full fare. I even requested airline staff on 12/11/17 (when discovered that flights were changed and I had to go to work that afternoon) to pay Jetstar and get my parents to Gold Coast safely and pay Cab Charge as it was not suitable for me to pick them up due to work commitments as the above was their fault. Airline staff claimed that had to pay and then apply in writing, which is not practical as i needed the money there and then to organise the services. Fiji Airways caused lots of distress to my parents and the rest of the family on the day. The next day my Dad was having difficulty walking and I have a letter from GP to provide evidence that Mum and Dad carry their suitcase around Sydney International Airport to Domestic caused them pain and discomfort. My Dad had to seek medical advice and is currently on medications to help him post carrying 3 large suitcases and Fiji Airways failing to provide them wheelchair service as agreed at Nadi Airport. I strongly feel the distress caused by the airline and failing to provide the service and neglecting elderly passenger, my parents should be given full refund of their air fare. It was not my parents fault is the airline has overbooked passengers and also not to inconvenience elderly couple, they could have chosen younger passengers who are fit. It appeards the airline staff foung elderly people vulnerable and unable to represent themselves- they took advantage of their vulnerability–I take this as a form of elder abuse and neglect. I LODGED A COMPLAINT ON PHONE ON 12/11/17 AND REQUESTED IF A SENIOR AIRLINE STAFF CAN CONTACT ME ON 13/11/17 WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED TILL TODAY(19/11/17.) The airline has made money from my parents and they do not care the harm they have caused to the elderly passengers. I am happy to talk to anyone if you need more information.

Irina,"November 18, 2023",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,3,2,1,1,4,1,No,"My flights this summer were good, normal, although food would be good to have for a flight from Madrid to Helsinki… what suprised me more is the time it take to collect the luggage. We were waiting for nearly 1.5 hours, with a lot of people in the same place (maybe the whole Finland? It was too much people for that space). No any people from the company, sometimes a message by radio, quite a cold and robotic one… At least in the last year it was corrected and now it is possible to book for the pet instead of making a special purchase by email and lengthly procedure. However, this year I have another problem with refund of the ticket, as I consider the closure of Finnish boarders as a force majeur… while the chat on the web site does not work, and there is no way to communicate with something that is not a robot to get any possibility of understanding and option of solution… Technology is good until a certain point. FINNAIR lacks the human touch."
Eugene,"September 3, 2023",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Flight was delayed for 10+ hours from Singapore with no communication from staff on the ground. There was severe lack of planning, management, staff and control. They did not account for the connecting flights and were makings things up on the fly. No words can fully express my disappointment in the airline. Please think twice before flying with Finnair."
Thomas,"August 18, 2023",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,3.0,1,3,2,3,,1,2,No,"Finnair is infamous for having a terrible frequent flyer programme and things got a lot worse recently. My recent experience: – expensive flight compared to other airlines – recent changes to frequent flyer benefits meant I would have had to pay for the bag that was included with the old rules – assigned middle seat for no reason (plenty of seats where still available when I checked in) – I paid for my seat and was still put in the last group – boarding procedure changes from flight to flight for no apparent reason (several other passengers were confused) – in sum: an overall experience worse than with one of the super cheap airlines, but for a much higher price. If you have options, stay away."
Gergely,"March 4, 2023",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,1,0,No,We missed our flight from LAX because of a car problem during the way to the airport. I called the customer service two hours before the scheduled departure and they were unable to rebook the flight to another day during a one hour call. They promised to change the ticket for the next day but later they told me that next day is not available just one week later. Finally they told me they are unable to do the change and they told me in a second call that they cannot do the change because their booking system is not open at the time. They suggested that I should call three hours later which I did but than they told me that it’s too late to change the flight and I lost my ticket.
Tammy,"March 4, 2023",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,2,1,1,3,1,No,"Finnair lost my bag and I didn’t get them until 5 days later. They didn’t tell me about their reimbursement policy and when I tried to provide receipts for reimbursement, the requests were denied. For ruining my 50th birthday to Finland where I had had no warm clothing to venture outside of paid activities, I was given a small reimbursement to be used on their plane. The trip home was so delayed while waiting for a tour group that I had to beg my way through London (and was the last person on the flight). The were literally closing the gate on me and didn’t want me to board. It was my first experience with Finnair and the worst experience on any airline I have ever had. They just don’t care that they have negative impacts on people. I paid a lot for my trip in October and just received my “gift card” for use on their airline TODAY. Not only was time wasted in trying to get justice for the problems and additional expenses they caused, but there was never an apology or any real compensation for their negligence and poor customer service."

As a cheap flight company they overbook their flights, meaning that even though you have a ticket, they might refuse you to get on the plane. This happened to me. I would have expected an apology and instant help to get me on the next flight, but this didn’t happen. Their flight attendant tried to put the blame on me saying that it was my fault and I was late for the flight. I wasn’t late, I had 2 people lining up in front of me who got on the plane, when the line got to me I got told that sorry you can’t get on as there are no seats left. Also, the flight attendant wasn’t really helpful with finding a solution she was acting like it was not her problem. Very poor customer service!!"
Peter,"March 10, 2022",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,,0,No,"Flying with Finnair was absolutely the worst travel experience of my life. Gate attendants were incredibly rude. I have been trying to arrange for the refund I was told I would get, but customer service is virtually non-existent, a complete run-around. I’ve been lied to by Finnair agents who take hours to get in touch with. DO NOT fly with this horrible excuse for an airline. I’ve never been angrier about anything than I am with the abusive treatment of this shit-sucking, soulless corporation."

We followed his instructions when we got home (more than a month later) and then when we never got a response we called the airlines and they refused to give us our money back because it was not within the “21 days” something their representative never explained to us (even though we asked). In the meantime they put a Finnair sticker all over my plastic luggage that would not come off, causing me to have to throw my almost new luggage out…they refused to pay for that too. Not impressed with the awful experience I had with Finnair. I fly often and have used many airlines but this is by far one of the worst experiences."

After paying the full charge of the ticket about 1200 pounds which took a minute to clear from my account. A week later I realised that I don’t really want to fly so happily I call finnair and here start this nightmare ordeal at first they told me about a week to 10 days, I was quite shocked why its taking so long. But I decided to wait patiantly after a week with no refund I call again this time they said a week to 10 business working days, a week later they said because the corona outbreak it may take 20 business days.I ask them to ascalete the case which didn’t seam to help with this meter I would suggest to other people to be aware of Finnair behaviour and look for airlines that if the ticket is refundable will do it at ones like British Airways!!! I’m still waiting for my money back which look like it may take a long while before I ever get it. And from what I read from other reviews I’m not the only one who is chasing Finnair"

Asko,"December 24, 2019",Finnair,4.1,Flew Business Class,5.0,1,2,1,0,,3,1,No,From Berlin to Helsinki in Business class. Finnair seats are not comfortable at all. Just normal seats but there is one empty seat between passengers. Internet did not work although it is complimentary in the business class. Staff was just sorry about it but could not do anything else. Food was terrible. It looked terrible and there was no taste in it. Staff just was sorry and watched it. I did complain it to Finnair and they were just sorry and provided 2000 points. I paid 1000€ for nothing.
Suze,"December 18, 2019",Finnair,4.1,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"After paying $5,200 for two economy flights from Melbourne to Denmark with Finnair I discovered that Finnair would not provide a meal to meet my dietary requirements – the first time I’ve ever experienced this on an international flight. The only option was for me to provide my own food for a 25-hour journey. Fine. Upon check in, my husband and I found that we’ve been seated separately in two middle seats, despite being booked, paid and ticketed together. Despite there being other seats available on the flight, we were told that we could only be reassigned if we paid an additional AUD$150 per person, and even then we would not be seated together. This would bring our total spend to $5,500, sitting separately and with no meal."
CHRISTOPHER,"October 28, 2019",Finnair,4.1,Flew Premium Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"I travelled Finnair for the first time return from Berlin to Tokyo via Helsinki. On the way there, all flights were economy, on the way back the Tokyo to Helsinki flight was business. All flights were operated impeccably. The Finnair staff were extremely polite and helpful, the food was good, the inflight entertainment was varied and, in comparison to other European and US airlines I’ve flown with long haul, they outperformed them all."

Would totally recommend."

They broked the strollers so we want to declare the damage imidiately. Wheel and a part of the stroller is broken! Also strollers are in the angle so can’t go straight or stand straight. Company Flydubai suggested us to change the wheel and probably Go only left?! Also, in our country there is no replace wheel to buy! Also, we had to buy a new strollers in Dubai for seven days with the baby. We couldn’t go with the carrige, right?! They admit and it’s deniable that this is their fault but don’t want to pay for the damage and inconviniance for buying new strollers on vacation!"
Cristian Mihail,"June 12, 2023",Flydubai,4.1,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,No,"The temperature in the passenger cabin was 16 degrees Celsius from the beginning. We were struggling to resist like in a fridge. After takeoff, I asked two stewards to do something. Many passengers search for extra clothes, hats, and hooded sweaters. After a while, the temperature increased to 18 degrees C, but after two hours of flight, my portable thermometer indicated 16 degrees Celsius again. I asked a steward again to do something; our kids were sneezing and coughing. Nothing happened this time. I asked for a hot tea, and I received it after 25 minutes !!! After 4 hours and 40 minutes, we arrived at our destination chilled and shivering from the cold. I am an aircraft engineer, and I know how this works. The captain who sets the cabin temperature doesn’t care about the passenger’s comfort. If you are asking about the rest: garbage food, anytime delays at takeoff, no priority boarding if you travel with children. I see no good future for this flight company if they continue like that …"

Pegah,"July 26, 2022",Flydubai,4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,4,1,1,3,3,1,No,I expected way more from this airline due to the fact that the money they ask for approximately equals the ticket price of high-level airlines like Qatar Airways or so. For sure it does not worth the money. They eighter do not provide the service at all (they did not have any blankets even though we were okay to pay for them) or they sell the service (which is expected and okay if you are traveling with inexpensive airlines but that does not include flydubai for sure). The staff was not helping at all even though they would promise to.

The whole process from booking through to de-boarding was done flawlessly and efficiently. During the pandemic, the airline made sure that everything was safe without compromising on quality. Fare was lower than other airline in the same sector , this was a trip that was needed to be made and the crew and airline did really well. There was sufficient information regarding the destination regulations for each destination which was of tremendous help. The crew enforced the safety regulations well and the staff were polite throughout: from bag drop till de-boarding. Thank you for the flight."

During check-in, I requested for a wheel chair but they said they need 48 hours notice to arrange that. I told them I didn’t know what this process and it’s a necessity now cause my mother can’t walk. After almost 30 mins they manage to get one. I was a little disappointed this time. I also gave my feedback to the floor manager and he did mentioned sorry, otherwise we always had a great travel experience with them."

This was out first flight since covid hit the world. This is an appreciation post for the wonderful service we got from Fly Dubai . Apart from good COVID safety precautions, we also had a quite comfortable flight. I had a brief conversation with one of the cabin crew members where I might have mentioned the reason of our travel. The same crew walked up to my wife just before the landing and gave her a sweet handwritten note wishing us on our 1st anniversary. It was such a sweet and thoughtful gesture. We will always cherish this beautiful experience. It was beyond our expectations. We definitely recommend it to everyone."
Jeffrey,"January 22, 2021",Flydubai,4.1,Flew Premium Economy Class,9.0,5,5,5,1,5,5,3,Yes,Fly Dubai is one of the best budget airlines in the Middle East for sure. Tickets are available for very reasonable price. Flights mostly have on time arrivals. Cabin crew and ground staff are well trained to handle any situation. On board service is good. Choice of meal is also not bad. Aircrafts are well kept with comfortable seats and good legroom. Please introduce IFE in economy class as well just like you have it in business class cabin. It is a customer oriented airline overall.

My elderly parents got bumped from flight, had to sleep in airport, and had to fly to destination 2.5 hours away the next day in order to get home on time.

On the return leg they lost one of my bags, would provide no help at airport to track it, they called the next day to tell me I abandoned the bag and “we’re going to ship it back if I did not collect it”.

I go to chat (Customer Service is via Chat) and when I tell you I have been contacting their specialists, management about a simple $88 refund. Everyone only saw the second trip even with the confirmation emails and codes I provided. Finally, I tried again today determined to either get the trip that was PAID for or refund. Two hours, three emails directed to their higher-ups, Bank Rep, Chat Rep, and a chat rep Manager to finally see the error in their ways-THEY NEVER REFUNDED. Ignoring the same documented proof, I sent and vocalized on MULTIPLE TIMES!! Honestly, I am not faulting the Representatives.

There was never an announcement, explanation, or apology by her, the gate crew, or the flight crew.

Sandra,"March 20, 2022",Frontier Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Once my family got checked in and through security, Frontier sends a text message that the flight was delayed. The delay went from 2 hours to 6 hours and the airline left everyone stranded in a closed airport.  My family went to a relatives and get some rest only to find the airport security closed when they returned.  When we called Cleveland Hopkins, we were told that Frontier did not notify them that the flight would be delayed so there was no one to let my family (and several others)into the boarding area – so they missed their flight.  They were ungraciously treated when they were rebooked, and didn’t offer even a free soda on the flight.  Once again 30 minutes before their flight was to take off on the next night, Frontier sends a text that the flight was delayed. So once again my family spent another 5-6 hours at the airport waiting on Frontier.  When they finally arrived in Tampa they were met with a very rude customer service person. My family hadn’t slept in nearly two days and been jerked around  absolutely NO apology and then treated like crap to boot."
Heather,"March 8, 2022",Frontier Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,1,1,No,"Flights 4 days apart were both cancelled. Both times several reasons were given, while they kept us at the airport only to cancel the flights entirely. The first flight I spent over 6 hours at the airport prior to them canceling it, too late in the day for me to find arrangements for that day. Finally made it to my original destination. Upon my return trip the same thing happened. They wait until you are at the airport, announce a delay of the flight, despite knowing that the plane is inoperable. Kept us at the airport for over 7 hours and then finally canceled the flight. There were 3 gates in a row at Tampa that had planes with mechanical problems that resulted in severe delays or cancelations. I WILL NEVER FLY FRONTIER AIRLINES EVER, EVER AGAIN!!!"
Antonio,"December 4, 2020",Frontier Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Never use them. Flight was delayed three times and was to leave at 6:00 am. At noon they canceled it. Been trying to get my $75 baggage fee back now for 4 months and the flight refund took 2 months. If your flight is cancelled you are SOL because they will not book you to any other airline while you fight to get your money back. I will never use them or a low budget airline ever. Tried to book me on one of their late night flights at 10:00 pm the same day.

First they lied by calling it a schedule change and then to add insult to injury they said since the replacement flight did not go into the next day (it arrived at 11:59 PM!) that it was a same-day schedule change.  They then offered me a 90 day credit if i canceled.  This company will not give you your money back for any reason.  Once you pay you are stuck if there is any issue.

Entertainment was ok, although I just watched my iPad. Food was so so but edible. Nil alcohol available until the main meal which took a long time to be served. Even though there was a pre-meal bar service there was no alcohol available. I get why they do this (RSA) however the behaviour of a number of idiots mean the rest are penalised. When drinks were available there was no spirits only beer or Indonesian wine which was awful. Crew were nice enough but I wouldn’t proactively choose to fly Garuda. Looked at upgrading but the minimum bid was $720AUD which we felt wasn’t worth it."

Not only was it once again cancelled but I was told 24 hours in advance and the reason was due to the Australian government restrictions which were put in place OVER ONE MONTH AGO. This airline need to manage their flights better and tell customers when they EXACTLY HAVE A SEAT!! By the looks of it they are bumping people off flights if someone else pays more. I had travelled from a remote island in Indonesia to Denpasar airport just to be told my seat was no longer available and there was nothing they could do. The travel time took 3 days and 3 nights and over 200 Australian dollars of travel expenses, and the next flight available is in 2 WEEKS which will cost me even more in layover time."

Rosabelle,"November 27, 2018",Garuda Indonesia,7.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,3,1,2,,,1,No,"I recently flew with Garuda Indonesia to HongKong in October 2018. I departed Jakarta on October 20th and my flight was delayed for 4 hours! and one of the hour was inside the plane with very minimal information to passengers as to why we’re sitting on the runway for that long. The airline did not give any snacks, food and beverages to passengers because of this delay. As a result I arrived much later in HongKong and that was such as huge waste of my vacation time! The food for a 3+ hour flight is inedible!! the worst that I’ve had for longer flight time. The crew’s service was so bad. no smile and rude and I even got a “racist” treatment from the male flight attendant on my flight back from HongKong to Jakarta. The service was slow and seemed to only favor foreigners (flight attendants were so friendly and attentive and nice to westerners and that’s what Garuda is known for in my opinion). I wonder how they got the award for the best crew! They probably only interviewed and got the positive feedback from Westerners who were treated like Queens and Kings by Garuda Indonesia flight attendants. They so do not deserve the award at all. My family also got a bad service and treatment from Garuda Indonesia flight attendants on a Singapore-Jakarta flight in October. I will not make it my choice to fly Garuda Indonesia for international flight ever again. Service was very very very very very poor (i can’t emphasize the poor service enough!), food was inedible and aircraft is old and toilet is dirty."

Shane,"January 26, 2017",Garuda Indonesia,7.9,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,Best way to fly to Bali. There are so many options flying from Perth to Bali but Garuda is the one to go with. They have good departure and arrival times which allow a longer Holiday and no waste of days which when you are having a quick trip is important. The service is amazing and the extra cm or two of legroom  in economy really helps. They use a wide body a330-200 which is the largest aircraft used on the busy Perth to Bali route.

Differentiate how to handle check in baggage will be more point e.g sometimes, passenger take to much baggage to put on check in, it should be there is one special counter to handle it, so that the queue is not too long."

They offered us a carrycot yet we declined it due to my baby was too tall and active but then they gave my son several toys to have. There was another single woman passenger with a baby who cried all the time, but the staff was very helpful and made her comfortable. Overall, staff treated us like the first class passengers"
Lana,"February 5, 2022",Georgian Airways,6.7,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,No,"No food (only water) offered on a 5 hour flight (even for children), consitently for 2 years in a row, it’s really a disgrace, it’s like they’re transferring cattle not people. Also not allowing hand luggage for a child to be checked in for free when eith all other airlines we’ve been offered that service. Then charging ridiculous 130 euro to check in a bag at the airport. Airline magazine at the airplane 2 years old (from 2020). They don’t want to do anything for their passengers, just find easy way to take money. Never flying with them again."

Leila,"January 20, 2020",Go Air,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I had booked a ticket with GoAir and paid Rs 6,403 for the round trip. Four days before my flight from Hyderabad to Delhi (G8-424) GoAir emailed me that they were cancelling my flight for “operational reasons.” My flight was at 10:25AM from Hyderabad, The only options to rebook the flight that they gave me were a 5:30AM or a 11:30PM from Hyderabad. As a young woman travelling alone, neither of these options was conducive to a safe or comfortable journey and I was forced to cancel. They said they would only refund Rs 2,600 (much less than half the amount for the round trip) and also refused to refund the convenience fee charged by the agency. I had to pay an amount that was more than 400% higher to buy a new ticket with AirAsia (given that the trip was only four days away). GoAir has clearly made it a commonplace occurrence to cancel flights on short notice without offering reasonable or comparable alternatives to rebook."

Anupama,"January 20, 2019",Go Air,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,0,No,"Delay from passanger side is considered violation of rules, and stop him/her at boarding counter only, even the person reaches 30 mins prior (even person gets message from GoAir, kindly reach 25 mins prior at boarding gate). But delay from GoAir is okay, whether the pilots or airhostess come late by 20 mins or 30 mins or delay at runway by 308 mins. You can check the G8-143 logs. So, my feedback is – GoAir is the passanger hostile airline who should learn to be gracious towards passanger. Rules should be followed by both way not one way. I am grateful to other airlines who are quite friendly towards passanger, even they talk very nicely and politely. GoAir is the worst airline, staffs even don’t know how to talk to passengers , all feel themselves not less than bureaucrats. 😀"

I had prebooked my entire itinerary from seats to meals but was unable to do a web check in. When I called up your customer care to ask about the same, they only gave me abrupt answers like,” do it properly Ma’am!!”When i asked them to do the same, I got responses like,” if you can’t do it how will we. Maybe system is down” and finally they cut the call and never picked up! On reaching the airport as soon as I reached the counter , I was told that they have closed the checkin counters!! Like really, first you have a system issue. Your employees who are supposed to help us aren’t able to and then you guys increase our problems. I had even posted a complaint on your fb page and asked them to provide an explanation before my flight. The answer came only the next day after I was unable to board my flight!! you guys do not value a customer’s time and there is no proper escalation matrix. This was the first time I was travelling via Go Air and will be the last time. Because of the unprofessional behaviour of your employees I was stranded on airport .You guys act very stringent for rules when a customer is late but what about cases when you guys are late. when your employees aren’t competent enough to solve a problem. when your website does not provide proper information. Please provide me a complete refund of my air ticket!! This is highly distasteful and if this is the customer service you guys provide, it won’t be long before a competitor takes over!! There was no express checkin counter for GoAir on the entire Hyderabad Airport. No self check in kiosk. Also, I was still in line with a lot of customers when your employee decided that he will close baggage checkin just coz it was time. The customers weren’t late. everyone was waiting. Your operational efficiency is zilch."

I sent them an email when I got hotel together with photo. I got an email back from them saying that should have complained about it at the airport on landing which was ridiculous I was really tired when I landed. They knew my bag was in perfect condition when it was loaded because if it wasnÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t they make a note of it. Where on earth do they think that this handle was ripped off?  Perhaps they think I ripped it off myself in a fit of pique. Compare this to another of India’s low cost airlines GoAir. On 17-01-17 I had GoAir flight Bangalore to Delhi to connect with Jet Airways flight back home to Manchester but there was fog and flight was 2 hours late. This was not GoAir’s fault but the steward, a lovely guy called Vijaypal Kathore rang Jet Airways explained the situation, told them I had 2 bags both hand luggage size and would they let me on the flight if arrived slightly over cut off times. They said no. He pleaded with them but they said no. But he got me a car to the belts and i made it by 40 seconds – I joke you not !!"

We very well know that flight tickets either have no refunds or refunds with deductions. But this is not a normal case. We booked our delhi srinagar round way flight tickets from 25th- 27th Nov. 25th was from goair and 27th was from indigo. We had our hotel booking also, but as per the current situation in Kashmir, we had to cancel our trip as the hotel staff informed us that we won’t be able to go out of the hotel. It’s not allowed, and so the hotel refunded all our money as this is not a personal issue, that’s the country’s situation. Even we had a word with the indigo flight people, the flight was non refundable, then also they refunded the full amount. We made the same request to goair people but these people simply denied that this is not your policy. The condition of Kashmir is not as per somebody’s policies. But we’ll reach as many people regarding this issue to tell them about how you work, and people should not opt for goair. Moreover the seats in their flight is terribly congested and smal"

Not capable to open up an international flight and lead us to believe they were able to fly internationally like any other airline..I sincerely suggest this airline company to go on a different line of business and let the flying business which is one of the most important segment in the world be handled by airlines that actually knows what they are doing and how important that is for society.

Porém por algum motivo eu não conseguia fazer o checkin pelo aplicativo, liguei para a companhia e eles falaram que isso acontecia com frequência, que eu teria que chegar três horas antes para efetuar o checkin – ok! Dito e feito! Cheguei às 7pm no aeroporto e tinha uma fila GIGANTESCA com apenas 3 quiosques funcionando para 2 voous que aconteceria naquela noite, sendo uma para Brasília e Fortaleza (que no caso eu faria conexão em BH)… fiquei 2 horas na fila e quando chegou a minha vez falaram q o sistema estava dando um bloqueio no meu nome! A menina que estava tentando fazer o meu checkin pediu para eu esperar ao lado do quiosque enquanto ela tentava resolver o problema com um agente VIA WHATSAPP! Em pleno 2018 a menina utilizava o seu iPhone 5 para receber uma resposta do meu voou… tinha dado 9:15 e ainda nada de liberarem o meu checkin, dai a supervisora disse que eu não poderia mais despachar a minha bagagem pois os portões estavam fechando! Eu muito confusa e ansiosa perguntei qual era o problema que estava aparecendo e eles me disseram que o meu checkin estava sendo bloqueado pois o meu nome estava na polícia federal e que infelizmente eu não poderia entrar no avião!!!!! Nunca cometi um crime na minha vida, e pedi para que ligassem para a polícia ja que estava constatando isso pois não fazia sentido algum! Perguntei se eu poderia embarcar no dia seguinte e eles disseram que não, que eles não poderiam fazer nada e que eu iria simplesmente perder o voou…. isso já era 9:40!!! Eu arrumei um escândalo falando que isso era muita inconveniência deles e que eu tinha todo direito de entrar naquele avião pois se o sistema deles não prestam pra nada, isso é problema deles! (Ressaltando que – a menina que estava trabalhando no qiosque do checkin disse que isso já tinha acontecido com outras pessoas naquele mesmo dia) Milagrosamente eles conseguiram fazer o meu checkin, me deram o meu cartão de embarque e me mandaram CORRER SENÃO EU IA PERDER O VOOU!!!!! Fiquei 2 horas e 45 minutos em uma fila para ouvir isso! Perguntei a minha bagagem e eles falaram: não sabemos ainda mas ele vai aparecer em BH (?????!!!!!) Passei a noite em claro para quando cheguei em Fortaleza na conexão à minha mala estava jogada no chão! Outro ressalto é que – tenho dupla cidadania (americana e brasileira) – na hora de passar tanto pela imigração do Brasil quanto à imigração dos Estados Unidos não tive problemas ALGUM!!!!! Essa empresa é uma piada!!!!! Na hora de voltar para os Estados Unidos também não tive problema para realizar o checkin, quase que perco as datas mais importantes do ano com a minha família por causa de uma empresa de lixo que não sabe trabalhar direito!!!!"

This Brasilian airlines have pretty full flight only because you have not alternative to flight in Brasil (only Avianca, with less flight but much better quality). You feel the the bad attention to customer also in GOL internet site / Smiles account. If you dont have an Brasilian Keyboard you can not subscribe bonus miles service (@ for your email address will not accepted, the address field are wrong and not permitt to complete the procedure).

The aircraft they use for the Sydney to Changsha service is Airbus 332, however the business class configuration is 2 -2 -2 which is not convenient for the business class traveller. The inflight entertainment system is terrible, even worse than AirAsia, the budget airlines, very limited movies and games. The screen is pretty tiny which is a lot worse than the one in Cathay Pacific economy class. Food is good and they offer a variety of the choice but the taste is really bad and is too salty! They do offer complimentary drinks but they choice is very limited and the quality is super sad. Lounge is probably the worst, in SYD airport they use skyteam lounge, because this lounge is shared with all the skyteam airlines, so it is busy all the time and is hard to find a seat. In Changsha they use airport lounge, and the lounge is extremely tiny and theres no hot meals and drinks. The only thing they can provide are fruit , water , instant noodles. Overall, this is a terrible airlines that I’m not going to fly with again."

Brendan,"October 26, 2017",Hainan Airlines,4.9,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"I am a Director of two companies live in Melbourne, Australia. I am manufacture laser equipment for doctors and cosmetic clinics throughout Australia at a factory in Weifang, China and always fly business class to China with other airlines, which is usually a very pleasant experience. As a nervous flyer, I usually have a few drinks to relax just after takeoff then take two Valium tablets and go to sleep for a few hours. I had NO drinks prior to this as had just driven two hours from the Mornington Peninsula to the airport. I asked the air-hostess for a couple of drinks and consumed one small glass of Vodka and two glasses of wine. I was then refused a drink they until dinnertime some 9 hours later and still then refused a drink for no reason for the rest of the flight. I had a witness, Ms Linda seated directly on the left side of the plane, who appeared was of Chinese descent and said she was from Adelaide. Ms Linda gave me her mobile number as witnessed the whole event. She said it was very poor of the airline and could not believe my treatment, as I was not at all drunk or even over the legal limit even if driving a vehicle as would be impossible. Some nine hours after not being served any alcohol at dinner time and after the initial three drinks an hour after take-off as previously stated, the air-hostess still said no and then another hostess just laughed and said we are empty! This indeed seemed to be of some amusement for the cabin crew treating me this way and humiliating to say the least. I then called for actual the co-pilot of the plane who was a very nice fellow called Mr Flavio Olivari who said I should get a refund as my treatment very poor and to mention his name. He said he could not make them serve me a drunk but was very poor from the cabin crew. Coming home my seat would not recline and there was no sound on the movie tablets! After no response to several emails and letters, I engaged law firm, ‘Collins Biggers & Paisley Lawyers’ in Melbourne and they received a response yesterday by the same email address; [email protected] saying; “Good afternoon. Via understanding the situation, cabin crews in your flight offered you service strictly according to process. Welcome you choosing our flight again. Best Regards. Beijing Capital Airlines” This was a slap in the face and doesn’t even make sense and don’t even say a contact name. Do yourself a big favour and NEVER fly with Hainan Airlines!

I voiced my concerns about comfort to the flight attendant from the beginning, just to make them aware.  To my surprise, two very amazing flight attendants Mica and Zoe went above and beyond. I was able to sleep comfortably because they found me a row of seats all to myself. They ensured I was able to eat every meal. I have never received such great service and care. I’m especially thankful for these two and their efforts. Thank you Mica and Zoe!"

Since they had no similar flights available, I asked for a refund and was promised one. The agent who promised the refund issued me a refund on the tax only, approximately $45. She told me the balance, the actual ticket prices of approximately $1,400, would be refunded within 7-10 business days. It has been one month, and still no refund and I can not get HA to explain to me why even though I have called, emailed, chatted, and used their online complaint process. This is the worse customer service I have ever received and HA is in violation of Department of Transportation guidelines."

When I Chose the Window Seat in the EXIT ROW, the Flight Attendants before every flight that they always let us passengers if there was an emergency to see if we can assist the Flight Attendants to evacuate the aircraft and to locate the LIFE JACKETS.

Alisha,"May 17, 2018",Hawaiian Airlines,4.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,3,,,1,No,I took a trip to Hawaii for the first time ever for my honeymoon with my husband. Somehwere I had planned to go since I was a child. The island is beautiful and the people are lovely. Unfortunately the staff and customer service wasn’t. We were left hungry both on the way and back as they couldn’t provide a vegetarian meal even though I had checked double times both ways. no effort was made to provide substitute food and the staff has very little concern. The 9 hour flight was a struggle and we will not be flying with them again. After complaining we received 100 credit with the airline. Not sure how this helps me?
Geoff,"April 27, 2018",Hawaiian Airlines,4.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,2.0,2,3,1,3,,,2,No,"Paid extra for Premium Economy seat from Honolulu to Sydney, a 10 hour flight. The extra legroom was great but seat still not too comfortable. The first meal was ok but second meal (over 6 hours later) was just a sandwich and a drink. The biggest disappointment was how rude most of the cabin crew were. During the flight i was quite thirsty and i rang my buzzer for crew assistance. A female attendant came over and said “yes”, i asked for a coke and she rudely said this to me “i will get your drink this time but in future you can go to the galley there (she pointed) and get your own drink”. I was dumbfounded. The passengers around me couldn’t believe what they just heard. And to top things off, i was in the window seat and a female passenger was asleep in the seat next to me. Do they actually expect me to wake up a fellow passenger so i can go and get a drink. First and last time i will be flying Hawaiian. I always imagined this airline would be one of those airlines where you walk away telling everyone about the beautiful crew on board, not how rude they were."

Judi,"August 16, 2017",Hawaiian Airlines,4.6,Flew Economy,1.0,3,2,3,1,,,2,No,Lousy communication and foreseeing needs. Ten hour delay arriving home at 5 AM. Not acceptable. We were a party of 9 and will never fly this airline again. Many of the people on the plane said the same thing. One passenger said it was his 3rd flight on Hawaiian in a year and all of them were majorly late. I received information on travel credit and I tried 3 of the boarding passes. I got the error sign each time. I finally ripped up all the information since I don’t plan on ever flying this airline again. I have shared this information with dozens of people already to make sure they never make the mistake of booking with Hawaiian.

Out of 2 weeks Hawaii vacation with 2 family this was to worst experience. Very humiliated, discriminated, have not felt like this even in other 3rd world country or Europe..Just because one carry on bag out of 8 for 8 passenger had 5 lb more which we were ready to pay for. Whole family was pushed aside and  threaten to miss that flight to Kona. When you travel you don’t carry weighing scale with you..if you need to charge extra that’s fine, a person who is flying this long with 8 person obviously not going to argue over $35 …you don’t treat like we are not wanted on your island…."

Mike,"May 16, 2017",Hawaiian Airlines,4.6,Flew Premium Economy,8.0,4,4,4,5,,,3,Yes,"We flew HNL to Syd last week, we chose Extra Comfort which is the Hawaiian equivalent to premium economy, first up, priority security screening was not made available to us, although their web site says it is included in the price, priority boarding was not enforced either, so the extra money paid for that was useless and there was no welcome drink which I thought would be a nice touch even if it was water. Food was average and on a par with Jetstar and the flight attendants were good without being overly friendly. The aircraft was clean and the seat quite comfortable, we chose seats 11A & B so that was worth the extra money alone."

I agreed to get it down to 70lbs to pay $50. I was speaking my mind and told the supervisor at the airport that Hawaiian Airlines wants to excessively maximize their profit at the expense of passengers needs. The supervisor did not like what I said and yelled at me: “You are not flying with us today, go to United Airlines!”. I asked to talk to a manager while I followed her to the office. She then yelled hysterically “security! he is stalking me!”. Manager came out of the office, who hadn’t observed the situation or heard my story and she said the same, “go to United Airlines”."

Steven,"February 25, 2017",Hawaiian Airlines,4.6,Flew Premium Economy,3.0,2,4,5,3,,,2,No,"Also worth noting is that in this age of airlines posting huge profits and giving bonuses to their employees, Hawaiian didn’t miss a chance to make more money. Our aircraft to and from Hawaii was a new Airbus (A340 I think). The temperature for the duration of the flight was cold enough to make both my wife and I shiver. The answer? They conveniently offered to rent passengers a blanket and a pillow! The temperature stayed cold both trips until almost on the ground. My feet froze the entire flight, and I was wearing closed toe shoes and sox. They also charge $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second. Almost as soon as were in they air, we were offered bottled water for $3 among other items.  When they offered Hawaiian credit card applications, I just chuckled. No way. We will choose another airline and unless absolutely necessary, will not fly Hawaiian again!"

I arranged the trip since 2 months in advance.Finally, ended up with 45 hours delay!!!!!!!!!! The plane failed to take off twice, so that they had all passengers get out and promised to contact them back. They got my number, but never contact me. I stayed in the origin airport waiting for around 12 hours without any contact back!! I couldn’t find their crew or office in the terminal area! Can’t even find their contact number in NZ branch until I went to airport help desk. It was useless, since I had to ring them many many times and wait on the line 10 mins every time! In the afternoon, I could see their crew came! I supposed they would be helpful to deal with my problem, but HELL NO! They acted like it is the customer fault!! I told them it was very very hard to contact anyone from your company to rebook my flight, they said well you have to try by yourself! (I had been trying for more than 3 hours! and already waiting for more than 12 hours!). Until, I couldn’t hold my anger, I asked for the refund! One staff responded ” I am not a cashier or a reservation person! What do you want me to do!?” So freaking rude!"

As I have a same-day connection, I cannot take the flight. The airline gave me two rebooking options without fees one week before or after April 29, 2019, for the same route or a different route. Since the period of my travel has been fixed and they don’t have flights to Nha Trang every day, I had to change to a BKK flight. First, I was told that a change to a flight to a different country was not possible. I told them that there was no such restriction on the message notifying me of the change. After some checking, they said it was OK. However, the ticket price was higher, since it must be changed at the call center where ticket prices are generally higher than on their website. The BKK ticket ended up more expensive than their competitors. This is clearly unfair. The change was forced on me, not my choice. Think twice if you want to tak HK Express. For me, this is my last ticket with HK Express."
Tom,"September 28, 2017",Hk Express,1.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"What a horrible experience with a disgusting company. HK Express has no concept of customer service. When we got to check-in counter for our return flight from Tokyo back to Hong Kong, we were told our flight was closed. They had brought the flight forward by 50 minutes, and failed to notify us, although they claimed they had sent an email (a gentleman beside us was in the same predicament). Efforts to speak to anyone in authority were unsuccessful. We were simply abandoned and had to book a flight with another airline. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any portion of our fare . This company is despicable."
Eddie,"August 18, 2023",Hong Kong Airlines,4.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,No,"Robbery by the gate!! When HK Airlines sold the ticket, they said one luggage is included and also free carry on. But when you booked the seat at the counter, they ask for luggage fees. From Shanghai to Hong Kong charging  RMB 5000!! (almost over $700 US dollars for two luggage) It’s too late to go back to ticket agent to verify. If you don’t pay up, they will be “happily dump the luggage for you”.  This is like asking for your checking account info in the middle of your operations when you are helpless. THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING AIRLINES EVER!! DO NOT FLY THEM EVER!"
Dinuka,"September 25, 2019",Hong Kong Airlines,4.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,Hong Kong Airlines is the worst airline to book flights with because they regularly change their schedules and do not care about what passengers have booked with them.  I booked a flight in March of this year for travel in December and Hong Kong Airlines changed our flights twice costing me extra money to make changes to our hotels. At the end they offered me a full refund 3 months prior to departure when I had booked my flights 6 months prior.  I told them the reason I booked my flights in advance was to get decent prices on flights and offering me a refund now would be useless as it would be impossible for me to find similar flights now.  The airline did not seem to give a damn! Do not fly with them!
Hoainam,"August 29, 2019",Hong Kong Airlines,4.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"booked a flight from LAX to SGN, laying over in HKG. When I boarded from LAX to HKG, the agent checked my US passport and visa and didn’t say anything. I got to HKG and tried to board from HKG to SGN, the gate agent refused to let me board, claiming that I didn’t have enough blank page for immigration in Vietnam. I have traveled to Vietnam more than 10 times. I stayed that night in HK, came to the US Embassy first thing in the morning, got an emergency passport, with the sticker saying it’s a replacement for my old passport number. I called HK Airlines, paid them the rebooking, got a ticket for the flight to SGN, before the flight, HK Airlines refused boarding to me again, even with the new ticket and the new passport, claiming the visa doesn’t match the passport number, even with the sticker. They asked me to get an emergency visa, which cost me another $250. If there was a real problem, they should have stopped me from boarding at LAX, instead of trapping and stranding me and giving me all kind of hard time in HKG"

IFE was ok. Food was absolute disgrace – absolutely inedible dimsum, cold dumpling with stuffimg that looks like mystery meat. Tastes unfresh. Worst airport food Ive seen, same as when I flew with this airline to Okinawa last year too. On that flight, seems the pilot was tipping his joysticj left to right with little wind on landing. Plane was wobbly and cabin suddenly silent, petrified. What a feelimg of relief when landed."

Keith,"October 12, 2014",Hong Kong Airlines,4.7,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,5,4,,,5,Yes,Airbus A320. Shanghai to Hong Kong. Departed on time from Shanghai at 08.00 and arrived into Hong Kong at 10.20. Breakfast was very good and the Cabin Crew were very good offering extra coffee and tea and a blanket if you required one. The aircraft was economy seating only as no business class fitted. This is the third time I have flown with Hong Kong Airlines between Hong Kong and Shanghai and return. The two previous times were on Airbus A330 aircraft. The first two times they bus you to Aircraft from the terminal at Hong Kong and bus you back to the terminal after arriving back in Hong Kong. This last flight the aircraft went to the terminal and we exited into the terminal. Overall good airline to fly with without any hassles.

Both flights were on time and the staff were polite and efficient – I was amazed by how quickly we were able to board and by the fact that we were in the air literally a couple of minutes later! The only item missing was an onboard meal (we were only given a drink and a packet of dried fruit and nuts), though I believe they offer this on international flights and it would be unreasonable to expect this given the low price of the flight."
Tim,"August 9, 2023",Iberia And Iberia Express,2.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Terrible. Our bags lost twice in three days and made to wait days for their return thereby ruining our trip. The fact that at San Sebastián there was a lady waiting for the four people whose bags had not been put on their flight and at Rome there were over forty people says everything. If you fly Iberian send your bags by mail! This is probably also why most passengers take way to much cabin baggage which the crew push into overhead lockers and force you to have under the seat in front of you so you have no leg space. Don’t fly Iberian.
Miguel,"July 12, 2023",Iberia And Iberia Express,2.6,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,,1,3,No,"Without a doubt, this has been the worst flight experience I have ever had; On April 5th, my wife and I traveled from Mexico City to Madrid (Flight IB 6402). Upon arriving at Barajas Airport, we proceeded to the baggage claim area, and after waiting 1.5 hours, we went to the Iberia counter to file a complaint. They provided us with a receipt that had no logo or much information that could identify them, It should be noted that none of the passengers on this flight received their luggage. The luggage was delivered 3 days later. I initiated the process of filing a complaint once that I got back to Mexico City;   Iberia showed some initial willingness to provide a refund, they requested my bank account information and copies of the expenses incurred. However, after I sent them all the required information, they stopped responding to my emails. My suggestion is to use alternative reliable airlines; At the end of the day, the costs incurred due to Iberia’s terrible service turn out to be higher than buying tickets with a more reliable airline."
julia,"March 2, 2023",Iberia And Iberia Express,2.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Iberia’s communication is outrageous.. I make a reservation in January (transoceanic flight) I make the payment through the page, everything seems correct, I receive an email with the flight details, locator, price, do not forget to travel documented, your luggage .. The title of the booking confirmation email. BUT somewhere in the email it mentions that I have made the reservation but that I must make the final confirmation of my ticket within 3 days. ? ? Gentlemen, communicate clearly with your customers!! It seems unbelievable that a national airline uses the RESERVATION CONFIRMATION title (for a reservation that could not be completed and as they have explained to me in customer service not finalised due to a payment error) vs. RESERVATION CONFIRMED when everything goes well. If the payment does not go through, say it in the website!. Called Customer Service 3 times, 0 flexibility and refer me to book a new flight, I am even thinking you do it like this to get more money from last minute bookings."
Erika,"August 2, 2022",Iberia And Iberia Express,2.6,Flew Business Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"July 27, 2022, flight from Orly to Madrid at 10h15, my 87 yr old parents were flying  on business back to San Juan, PR., Upon check in , the Iberia agent tells me that he cannot send the luggage through and that my parents had to collect them in Madrid and go through check in again for their connection. This was not acceptable. The situation was extremely stressing because they were only starting their long trip and already there were problems; finally a check-in manager came and resolved the issue. Another problem then, the agent did not want to provide the connecting boarding pass. The manager came back again to give the connecting boarding pass. All this lasted one hour standing in the counter; In the past years I have had issues with Iberia with customer service which is non- existent and the agents at Orly counter are not trained at all and are not professional. I will avoid this airline at all costs. Thankfully the check-in manager was there to resolve the issue."

The craft kind of old but I am sure it was safe .Never at any point I was able to hear clearly any of the announcement , The Captain never welcome or address passengers, The quality of the meal was a big JOKE . Very poor quality a dog food looks much better and more appealing  the cheap woods spoon ,knife and fork give me a break . The crew after they serve the meal they disappeared , they never checked in anyone . Snak time was a lot worse than the meal . One of the crew member was dragging the  apple and the banana in plastic bag on the floor . Would i fly or recommend Iberia again most likely not ."

This review is about connecting flights from Lanzarote to Paris Orly via Madrid. We booked the day before to replace a flight messed up by the Paris strikes. Iberia staff were very helpful even at 5 am and kindly helped my husband to a wheelchair. The first flight was fine although everyone worried about short connections as it was delayed. But all Iberia gates were in a small area. Anyway, the next flight was delayed! The flight to Paris was not good. There was a lot of turbulence, but not continual. Crew cancelled ALL food and drink. They brought water for kids but nothing at all to the rest of us. My husband is diabetic and had depended on having lunch on board! He rang the bell when the turbulence light went out but nobody appeared for ages and ages. Then we were told that it was too late to supply anything! The reason given for the lack of service was safety – I accept that, but somehow it was considered safe enough to provide a full service in business class. How come??? My ratings reflect an average of the two flights. Still better than some, IMO."

Indeed, my passport is going to expire in 5 months (19 January 2020) but according to Peruvian regulation, of which all Iberia’s staff should be aware, the residual passport’s validity cannot be less than 6 months upon the arrival’s date. I booked the flights months ago and uploaded all the passport details back then. I went through several passport controls (at least 3) and again nobody told me anything so I got to Lima and only then, at the last passport control, I’ve been told I couldn’t enter the country. Eventually I was sent back to London. Me and my partner had to fly back and both lost a huge amount of money, not only the money we spent for flying from London to Madrid and from Madrid to Lima but also the one we spent for accommodation, transportation and on site tours. Furthermore, my partner had to pay ~$1,700 for booking the same return flight to London so to fly together."

Now I tell you because you should never use this company: 1) Almost all the staff is very cold and not helpful at all. 2) We had to pay additional 120 (!!!) euros at the check in cause the luggage was “not included”. 3) For 10 hours flying you got advertisment (like Ryanair and low cost companies) and you have to pay for drinks. Is okay for a 2-3 hours flight….but what about 10 hours!?! 4) WHEN YOU TRY TO CHOSE YOUR SEAT THE WEBSITE ALWAYS GET “ERRORS”… SO YOU HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST 30 EUROS MORE (FOR EACH PERSON) IF YOU WANT TO BE SURE TO BE SEATED WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN A 10 HOURS FLIGHT! 5) THe price is a bit cheaper than other companies, but NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! 6) The seats are very very unconfortable and small 7) Dirty screen and dirty toilets. 8) Worst food I ever had in my life (the chicken tasted like garbage)"

We were sold a flight from Boston to Porto with a 1 hr layover in Madrid. We were held on the first plane for 40 minutes for unknown reasons, causing our connecting flight to start boarding before we got off the first plane. We were given standby tickets for the next flight (4 hours later) and didn’t get on as there were 10+ other people in the same predicament. The staff at the Iberia customer service were rude, disrespectful, and didn’t help us. Finally we got onto another flight by calling (3 times) and got to Portugal 8 hours after we were supposed to.

I enquired whether there would be any transport available from Tampa to Orlando but was told the only option was to cancel the whole booking.  We were also more than surprised to find that no meals were included on the flights to and from America and that the seat spacing and leg room was much less we would have expected on a transatlantic long haul flight.

We proceeded to email about an option to have 60 days to rebook. The agent said the system would’t allow this to happen.

Few passengers actually order food; – water that I got went bad, probably because was bottled long time ago. – I cannot rate the flight attendants because most of the time they have nothing to do; – in Iceland boarding and debarking were done on the tamarack because the airport was full of obstacles which made impossible for the airplane to make to the terminal; – Icelandair officials are not able to give right information and what is written on the boarding pass does not always coincides with where the boarding takes place. – seats are not reclining and the space between legs is very small; – the only good thing is the entertainment sistem."
Chris,"September 20, 2018",Icelandair,3.2,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"For over 3 months in advance of our trip, I attempted to contact IcelandAir about a concern I had with our names on our tickets not including our middle names. I tried calling IcelandAir which would either lead me to being hung up on due to high call volume, or being told I would have to wait over an hour on hold, and THEN, end up getting disconnected. The ONLY way I was able to contact ANYBODY at IcelandAir over 3 months before our trip was through TWITTER! That’s right. An airline’s ONLY WAY TO SPEAK TO CUSTOMER RELATIONS IS THROUGH TWITTER! IcelandAir’s website is still confusing, and their response to my basic question about ticket names was vague and unacceptable. They told me to “take responsibility.” I took responsibility by inquiring about this 3 1/2 months in advance. It’s not my responsibility for being confused and not able to get a proper response from the airline. That’s on IcelandAir. A couple of months later, after several more attempts at calling them, I had ANOTHER TWITTER CONVERSATION, which somewhat answered my question finally. I then picked out the seats I wanted and had an e-ticket for myself and my wife with our seats printed on it, only to find out the DAY BEFORE OUR FLIGHT HOME FROM EUROPE that those seats weren’t actually ours, and we’d be seated 15 rows apart! After dropping another $430 on business class seats, I ended up having to pay an additional $55 just so that we could sit in the seats we had already originally picked and had printed ON OUR TICKETS! We flew with FIVE OTHER AIRLINES within 2 weeks of our European trip, and had absolute ZERO issues with every other airline, and ONLY had issues with IcelandAir, that began and continued through over 3 1/2 months from booking until take off. The response I got over email (email!! AMAZING!! which was only available AFTER dropping $430 on business class seats) about our non-business class seats on our first leg flight was “we cannot guarantee any particular seat. We reserve the right to assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boarding of the aircraft as we sometimes have to change aircrafts.” Then why exactly did your website allow me to pick seats and then print them on our ticket!? They didn’t change aircrafts .We literally had nothing but extreme anxiety during our ENTIRE TRIP knowing that we would be flying with this terrible airline who has nobody to speak to in customer relations and could care less about the customer entirely anyway, which has been shown through their complete lack of responsibility. I will forever tell EVERYONE considering to fly with IcelandAir to LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT AIRLINE, because ICELANDAIR IS A NIGHTMARE!"
Wayne,"September 14, 2018",Icelandair,3.2,Flew First Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I am a seasoned traveler both business and pleasure over the last 45 years. I am retired now but reached a point of absolute confusion regarding my paid reservation with Icelandair. I totally understand that most, if not all, airline tickets are non-refundable but on those few occasions I have had to cancel a flight I have always received a future credit although it had to be used within 12 months. First what I did not know the 12 month date was from booking not the flight reservation date. I do not think it has always been that way but not hear to argue that. My story is that I was joining my wife on a two week business trip to Iceland, London and Amsterdam. She has does this every September including this year. I have joined her before on this trip. We book the trip in April for a September departure. I upgraded my self this time and my total airline ticket cost was over $2400. Recently my eight year old black Labrador retriever has developed cancer and there is no remedy. He is terminal but had a few months to live. Unfortunately the my trip to Iceland had to be cancelled because he needs to be taken care of and no boarding establishments wants to take him because it is too much responsibility. I called Icelandair and explained the situation and they said I could get a credit but had to be used by my original booking date in April. My wife only does this trip once a year in September and I have no reason to fly Icelandair except accompanying wife on her business trip in September. I explained all this to them but they had no remedy the credit MUST be used by April 2019. I explained I had upgraded and very politely asked them if they could consider an exception because apparently they do these on occasion. They came back with a blunt NO. Why is that the airlines have to treat people this way? They wonder why people are always upset and mad at them and the one time they could show a little humanism they can’t even consider it. $2400 is not a cheap deep discount fare. Why do they act like this? How would this hurt them? Why do they want me to spend the rest of my life trying to hurt their business and say negative things of them. Did they think I was make the story up. Even worse. Bottom line this is legal theft. What other businesses get to operate this way?"

You can not check in without buying a seat. of course you only find that out 24h before you fly, not when you book. even the middle seats cost and to trick you they only show expensive seats available – but when boarding you realize half the plane is empty. Forget taking luggage. it will cost you more the the ticket itself. the only good thing about this airline is the new fleet with AB 320 neo."

Their onboard meals are all overpriced, so I never buy them. On the occasions that I have bought them, I’ve found them to be below average. IndiGo should realise that we Indians take our food seriously, and have high standards in this area. Overall an ok carrier for short 1-2 hour flights. I would not fly them on longer hauls."

Instead of selling one ticket for my Kolkata-Tituchirappalli journey, I was forced to buy 2 separate tickets for Kolkata-Chennai and Chennai-Tiruchirappalli flights.  They do not sell a single ticket when there is a change of aircraft.  If the first flight is late, the second flight ticket becomes null and void. Also, they charge any excess baggage twice.  They charge kg of excess baggage per ticket, Rs 400 per kilo independent of distance flown. As they only sell separate tickets for change of aircrafts, the baggabe charge multiplies. As I had two separate tickets the baggage charge would be 2X Rs 400 = Rs 800 per kg.  No food  was served in the economy class.  The airline employees were also unfriendly."

Just hot water to be poured into instant noodle and instant upma cups all charged at exorbitant rates in US Dollars. So Charges in international rates but same domestic standards.

Comparing this price with other airlines is about half of the price. I loved the entertainment system and enjoyed 2 great movies on the way to Baghdad. The service was ok, had 2 meals for the whole flight and unlimited drinks and sweets. Prefect for my movies ;-). The take off and landings were smooth and comfortable. I’ve heard that Iraqi pilots have a tendancy of doing smooth landings. The overall experience was great and we landed 10 minutes before arrival time so I couldn’t get any better. It was their B737-800 if I remember correct from the safety video."

A can of coke for 3$ – a CAN. No entertainment throughout the 4 hour flight. If I get the chance to never ever fly with this airline again – I won’t.

Sarah,"February 2, 2020",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"I booked a premium economy ticket with Japan Airlines from Paris to Sydney via Helsinki.  I missed my connecting flight in Helsinki and was put on a Finnair flight in economy.  I contacted Japan Airlines when I got back to complain about this and to ask for a refund for this part of my flight.  Japan Airlines have told me it is not their problem and I have to contact Finnair.  I also asked several questions in my letter  – who decided I was being put on a Finnair flight, was Japan Airlines given the option of waiting for my flight, why wasn’t I asked if I wanted to fly the next day on a Japan Airlines flight.  None of these questions have been answered.  They have shown zero care factor or empathy.  AVOID JAPAN AIRLINES AT ALL COSTS!"
REBECA,"November 4, 2017",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew First Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"Only good things!!!I was super impressed from the start watching the attendants go onto the plane and bowing 2 by 2 towards the passengers. The staff made my flight super comfortable. They could not be sweeter. I loved the hand written note in the bathroom saying it was their pleasure to serve, and if I needed anything, just ask. Great attitudes, cleanliness, food, comfort..the BEST! Highly recommend."
Steve,"June 3, 2017",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Premium Economy,10.0,4,4,5,5,,,5,Yes,"For years, I’ve been using JAL flying around the world getting extra passport pages all filling up. With all flights getting all the mileages into JAL, I recommend this airline as my best and main for my personal and business. Going in and out from BKK, DEL, HKG, HNL, JFK, LAX, MNL, ORD, SIN, SYD, and etc all flight were good or superb. The only thing I didn’t like was the time it takes from point A to B, but I think everyone feels the same way regardless of the seat class. I usually take the premium economy to save money instead of using business where my company let’s me do so, but the company lets you put it in your pocket which is a benefit and it all goes away to your kids. Going back, despite the class you’re in, the entertainment, meal and even the smile is way better compared to other American airline companies. Though the flight cost is a bit higher than others, I can take that in exchange of the pleasurable flight time."
Wez,"May 25, 2017",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Economy,5.0,3,3,3,3,,,3,No,"My son and I took a roundtrip Kansai – Los Angeles route. The fair was reasonable. Ground staff was excellent. They were very detail, efficient, polite, and friendly.  Unfortunately, not the same with the cabin crew. On the way to KIX, the stewardess in charged forgot or simply skipped me when serving desserts. On the trip back to LAX, they also forgot to serve me my meal too.  My son got his though. I had to ask the steward that served my son for my meal.  I am not sure I will fly with JAL in the future unless I have to."
M,"August 20, 2016",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,4,Yes,"Last month, I flew with JAL with my kids to visit Japan.  I have always flown with JAL and I always received an excellent customer service. With my recent flight coming back to the US, I had THE best flight experience.  During my 12 hours of flight, my youngest son started complaining that the temperature being a little hot and it was making him hard to sleep. I used a in-flight booklet as a fan to make him  comfortable.  Then, suddenly, out of nowhere, a cabin attendant walked up to me to let me know that they lowered the temperature so I no longer needed to use a fan. This gesture clearly shows that cabin attendants keep their eyes on us to make sure that we are having a comfortable flight."
Leilanie,"April 2, 2016",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Economy,10.0,4,5,5,4,,,4,Yes,"We feel all the relief and favor when we approached JAL Team from Osaka, Kansai Airport to Itami Airport and Tokyo Haneda Airport. We made a mistake on our connecting flight. My friend Sheryl Collanto and I went to Osaka Kansai Airport instead of Itami for a connecting flight bound to Haneda airport. From 8:30am flight, we reached Kansai airport around 7am am. From there we need to rush going to Itami airport. When we reached Itami, it’s already 8:25 am and we lost the chance to board our flight. Japan Airline crew helped us board for the next schedule by 9:30am because our next flight is 11:30am. We need to be at Haneda Airport at least 1 hour before our flight. JAL crew assisted us and even carry my luggages until the boarding gate for our flight from Tokyo to Singapore. Japan Airline crew members are all very welcoming and so very helpful. They got superb service. They are highly recommendable. We experience a very efficient team. As for our flight experience, I can say it is smooth and perfect landing."
Mark Anthony,"February 24, 2016",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"There is no doubt that JAL has been awarded as Best Economy Class Seat of 2015 by one of he world’s airline and airport review and ranking guide company.  I can say that as I experienced it by myself with my previous flight on 14-February-2016 from Manila to Tokyo through their Boeing 767-300ER (flight JL746; seat 55K).  I can feel the difference comparing to my previous flights with JAL on their economy class, there is definitely a very obvious increase in their legroom as per their advertisement on their website dubbed as JAL Sky Wider.  JAL Sky Wider has the followign features: (1) up to 10 cm MORE LEGROOM due to a wider seat pitch (approx 7 cm) and slimmer seats; (2) WIDER seats and (3) EXTENSIVE STORAGE CAPABILITIES including accessory holders and plastic bottle holders (http://www.jal.co.jp/en/airline_awards/2015/)."
BARBARA,"February 23, 2016",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Premium Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,I flew Japan Airlines on January 19th from LAX to Tokyo and then on to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam. The LAX to Tokyo was a fabulous trip in premium economy. The flight attendants were the sweetest ever and we’re so very attentive. Please pass on my thanks to them. Barbara Lanan Clark
Maya,"January 6, 2016",Japan Airlines,7.9,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,4,4,,,4,Yes,This was my first long trip from SIN to HND to KIX and from NRT to SIN. The cabin crews were very good and efficient. Ground staffs are also very friendly and helpful during my check-in. Seats are okay and not squeezy and you have space to move. In-flight entertainment are good with some of the up to date movies and the food served are nice too.

Andy,"December 25, 2019",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,4,0,5,5,4,Yes,"Excellent all round service on Edinburgh-Verona route. Very efficient check-in at Edinburgh handle by Jet2.com’s own staff. Boarding very efficient.  Aircraft was a brand new B737-800, which was immaculately clean with a comfortable generous  seat pitch compared to other low cost and tour operator owned airlines. The cabin crew were polite and attentive.  At Verona both arrival and departure experience was a  fairly typical   traveler experience for that airport. On return to Edinburgh the flight arrived at a very high number gate  and the trek to the baggage return was excessively long  but this was not a fault of Jet2."
Kal,"August 7, 2019",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,,1,0,No,"The crew allowed a group of young people to board, who were very drunk and two of them were extremely disruptive, loud, at times aggressive, one of them wouldn’t sit down.

Aaron,"January 9, 2017",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,1.0,3,3,3,1,,,3,No,"Flew out of Sofia on Saturday evening to Manchester. To say i’m unimpressed by Jet2 would be an understatement. To begin with, check in was painfully slow, it was obvious the employee handling the queue was not adequately trained to handle the volume of passengers. We needn’t worry though, as our flight didn’t depart anywhere close to the departure time."
Steven,"November 19, 2016",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,4,Yes,"Can’t fault Jet2. Staff are very helpful and nothing is too much trouble. Generous baggage allowance, The aircraft was spotless, seats very comfortable with decent leg room. ( I am 6 feet tall) Food and drink  on board was tasty and well priced. Flights departed exactly on time. I will defiantly be flying with Jet2 again in future."
Veronica,"May 13, 2016",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,9.0,5,4,4,0,,,5,Yes,"Traveled JET2  with my sister from Glasgow to Larnaca return and was very happy with our choice . Seats quite short , but loads of leg room to stretch out .We pre booked seats together and in flight meals both ways which were very tasty . The cabin crew were helpful and pleasant and the cabin spotlessly clean .The only hitch was a half hour delay and being sent to the wrong gate ( quickly remedied ) on the return flight , however. the overall experience flying JET2 was definately superior to other budget airlines we have flown on this route , and I would certainly recommend anyone to give it a try . My sister and I have family members in Cyprus and we will be visiting them again , flying with JET2 !"
David,"January 5, 2016",Jet2,6.1,Flew Business,8.0,4,4,3,0,,,4,Yes,"I find Jet2 all that one can expect of a low-cost carrier. Hassle-free check-in when taking hold luggage, though I do object to the advert on the outside of some of their planes which says “22kg baggage allowance” but doesn’t point out that this has to be paid for. Service is good and the meals quite acceptable and at a reasonable price. They even offered to take my carry-on bag at check-in and put it in the hold, which suited me fine. Was pleased when they agreed to give some compensation when I had to cancel the flight, but Austrian Airlines wouldn’t."
Helen,"November 5, 2015",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,4,0,,,4,Yes,"it appears to me that people are more likely to leave reviews when they are not happy, so to even things up a bit i’m adding my review. Have flown several times with Jet 2 and it is now my airline of choice. Of course you pay extra for legroom and its well worth it. Lovely comfortable seats. Food not bad for a budget airline and good value. Staff are mostly friendly and helpful with the odd exception but hey we all have bad days.Booked again to fly Jet 2 next September and this time taking all the family so will be able to leave another review as there will be all ages travelling including 2 infants."
gary,"October 28, 2015",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,0,No,"This airline charges an excessive charge for failing to turn up with a boarding card. It is essentially extortion at 17.50 for a flimsy piece of paper. Quote ‘If you pay the Â£17.50 sir then you can’t fly’. It doesn’t help that the website booking and paperwork was very confusing and if I had known I would have printed it off. All I saw was ‘Take this document with you to the airport’ which is what I did. Total Rip Off. My wife and children were travelling on a separate booking as I was flying on from Dalaman. They didn’t have boarding passes but as they were flying on a different class of ticket they weren’t charged so basically one rule for those that can afford and one rule for those that can’t. As for flight it was ok at best. Seats are very uncomfortable. Flight was delayed and on arrival we were left to our own devices to find a jet2 rep. All in all Jet2 gave us an awful experience and we won’t be using them again. Cheaper to book a flight separately (with another airline), Book your own transfer and book your hotel separately. We priced our family holiday that cost Â£2200 with Jet2 and if we had booked separately it would have been closer to Â£1700."
Michael,"July 31, 2015",Jet2,6.1,Flew Premium Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Cabin crew ignored the comfort and safety of passengers, to concentrate instead on ensuring that the stag/hen party was supplied with alcohol throughout the 4 hour flight. The customer complaints department afterwards told me that it was my responsibility at the time to request a move to another seat rather than for the crew to stop serving alcohol to the party."
Peter,"August 1, 2014",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"During a 4hr 15minute flight to Dalaman (Turkey) departing from Newcastle UK, both toilets were notified by the captain to be out of use midway through the flight (unusable by passenger for between 1.5hrs to 2hrs), as upon arrival within Newcastle, the team had failed to empty the toilet facilities from the previous flight. Thereby any further use would lead to overflow. To our further distress:"
Christina,"June 13, 2013",Jet2,6.1,Flew Economy,8.0,5,4,4,0,,,4,Yes,"I travelled with my family from Venice Marco Polo to Edinburgh in May. Jet2 were the cheapest airline. We pre-booked meals and check-in at the airport. Everything (meals, check-in, luggage, seat allocation) is extra on top of the base price. However, the flight was good, staff friendly and helpful. They made a mistake with one pre-ordered meal, but were happy to negotiate an alternative. Checkin at the airport was efficient and when you have the luggage allowance it is a generous 23kgs. Only one cabin baggage though and they are strict about that. I would recommend this as a budget airline."

Worst airline ever
Lawrence,"July 18, 2023",Jetblue Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,1,1,0,,,0,No,The airline canceled my outbound flight less than 12 hours from takeoff. Their website wouldn’t allow replacement booking within 12 hours except for seats costing 6 times the original price. No customer service was available either by phone or online. A truly mean spirited and callous treatment
Muhammad Arslan,"March 9, 2023",Jetblue Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,2,2,0,No,"I was travelling from RDU to LHE and I had connecting flight at JFK, because my flight arrived late from Raleigh to JFK, I missed the connection to Istanbul. in short they denied me hotel and they said i can book my own and they will reimburse me, i was travelling in emergency, my brother had died the same day so i was totally out of order. so i stayed 8 hours in airport hungry then i called my cousin in UK he booked hotel for me and arranged some food, now listen about the craziest part, i called them about reimbursement and they said it was not approved by supervisor, when in reality i have the video proof of supervisor explaining me about reimbursement. this airline is fraud please don’t travels, i have been travelling since i was 18 and now i m 32, it is my worst experience of my life."
Kathia,"February 25, 2023",Jetblue Airways,4.8,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,No,"Showed up for our travel on 1/3/23 on time. JetBlue had a system error and could not check us in. Missed our connection due to this and arrived home 8 hours later than the original travel schedule. Purchased seats in advance for specific seats we wanted during our flights and they ended up seating us wherever and only partially reimbursing my seat purchase. Damaged our surfboard, properly packaged (traveled with it many times before no problem) and denied our claim but offered a $200 travel credit which we will NOT be using and still have to now purchase a new board. Purchased food on the flight for $5 and was charged $9. After us reaching out to JetBlue regarding the delay customer service reimbursement, they only offered us (3 of us) a $300 travel credit, which we will definitely will not be using. In summary, you might save $100 or so on a cheaper fare with JetBlue but you will end up paying A LOT for your travel in delays, bad customer service and a LOT of invested patience and energy. Do NOT recommend JetBlue for your travels. Hope this is helpful."
STEVEN,"November 9, 2022",Jetblue Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,5,,4,4,Yes,"I fly regularly from NYC JFK to Fort Myers, mostly on JetBlue. My last flight was yesterday from RSW to JFK. The fares have been great and I feel that even at twice the price you still get great value for your dollar. On this last roundtrip to RSW, the fare was so low I purchased the middle seat as an extra. Having the middle seat open is my “Poor Man’s First Class.” It truly is a wonderful feeling and takes away quite a bit of stress. But I have to say that the people I’ve talked to on the phone have been great as are the crews on the planes. I can honestly say I’ve never dealt with any employee that made me want to report their behavior. For the money paid and services rendered, I’ll gladly stick with JetBlue."

Merv,"July 24, 2021",Jetblue Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,3,1,3,1,1,3,No,"Last week I returned from Cancun and chose to fly with JetBlue. While my girlfriend and I were boarding the plane, the employee told us we would have to check our carry on bags. We explained to her that we had already checked bags and these were our carry on/personal bags. She proceeded to tell us the plane was full and that we had to check our bags. Not to mention, our carry on bags were filled with souvenirs for our families specifically bc we know this airline likes to throw luggage like Olympic shot putters. Well anyways, we complied and took as much fragile stuff out of our bags and moved them to our personal bags. We checked our carry ons and boarded. When the flight landed we noticed multiple people removing 4-5 bags from the overhead compartments including other people’s compartments. But we had to check our bags?! Well, we get our luggage and what do we discover?? The items in our carry ons that we now had to check were BROKEN.  Thank you JetBlue!"

Kerry,"March 15, 2020",Jetblue Airways,4.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Very disappointed in JetBlues customer service. I had recently booked a flight to Ireland through JetBlue with their partner, AerLingus. My 88 year old mother was told not  not to travel by her doctor due  to Covad-19. JetBlue advertises that they were waiving cancellation fees for flights through April 30th, our flight was April 20th. So I called JetBlue customer service to cancel but after waiting on hold for 53  minutes, the “crew member” told me they couldn’t help me and I needed to call AerLingus. I had been informed by JetBlue’s online support to call and ask for a supervisor who could assist with my request. When I asked the agent to be transferred to a supervisor she told me that I would have to wait another 36 minutes and that the supervisor wouldn’t be able to help me either. After a terse exchange in which I explained that AerLingus wouldn’t deal with me and that it was JetBlues responsibility,  I asked for her name and to be transferred to the supervisor. She immediately hung up on me. I have always been a happy TrueBlue member (since 2006) but this experience has changed that now."

In the last three weeks I had two problems with them on two different flights. Firstly, they charged me USD$65 for a checked baggage on a short distance flight in spite of their website saying “from USD$13.50”. I bought it online, not at the airport. The second problem I had with them was, that they left me at Bariloche airport saying that my ticket has been cancelled in spite of me having my boarding card on my phone! I paid for a checked baggage too and it’s all gone. I had to buy another ticked for a late flight and I lost my hotel reservation I had for that night in Buenos Aires. I spoke with them for 30mins on the phone and they were not listening at all. I will never ever use this airline in the future. The worst experience ever."

Main difference is their baggage policy. The allow for max 7kg and they weight your luggage (MEL- AYR) at the gate. Then they charge a AU$65 upgrade that does not provide any additional benefits if you want to board. This additional cost may change the airline chosen"
Andrew,"March 8, 2023",Jetstar,3.9,Flew Economy Class,5.0,2,1,3,0,3,3,2,Yes,"JetStar, what can I say…. recently I flew Perth to Bali return and Sydney to Perth. The international flights were surprisingly good. It would the seem the international operation is far more efficient and professional. Also the aircraft seating on the A320 is by far better than the domestic A321 which is cramped. If the domestic flight was 2 hours or less then it wouldn’t be so bad, but on the longer flight (Sydney to Perth) just not suitable."

And today, they told me I must file an online report for my case. They lost my Samsonite Wheeled Backpack, Philippine Passport, Metrobank Bank, China bank Passbooks, and ATM. My Philippine driver’s license & Health card, 4 U.S.A. Business Chase bank checks, eyeglass CARTIER, headphones, blanket, pen, Prescribe Diabetic Medical device, 4 pcs FreeStyle Libre 2, Computer accessories, Cellphone Chargers, etc. I had to spend money for Taxi twenty times going to NAIA Airport to contact Jetstar, Manila Airport Police, and a Philippine Banks Lawyer for an affidavit. I have to pay bank fees for lost ATM and Passbook. I have to visit Chase Bank to report my stolen checks and will pay bank fees for check replacements. I will spend money on San Francisco’s Philippine Embassy for the loss Philippine Passport. I will spend two days at Bank and San Francisco Philippine embassy.

Chris,"April 27, 2020",Jetstar,3.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I’m absolutely appalled Jetstar is not willing to issue a refund for our flight. We’re currently REQUIRED to shelter in place for our own safety during this world pandemic. Not to mention many of the international borders are CLOSED and we’re unable to fly. Yes, we’re all affected by this pandemic, and I understand the airline industry is hurting, but don’t attempt to profit off of your customers who aren’t even able to utilize your services. Issuing your customers a voucher that expires within 6 months is not acceptable. It’s not like we can just put our life on pause and travel whenever we wish."

Not only was the flight delayed by 8 hours, but the watch manager also displayed a level of utter rudeness and incompetence in handling customer requests. To begin with, received an email regarding the delay at 4:45 AM, when I was at the airport, was more than frustrating. Obviously Jetstar has known about this delay for a long time, but they have chosen to notify passengers at the last possible time. Their level of neglect and disregard for the time and inconvenience of their customers is completely unacceptable. As the delay dragged on for a grueling eight hours, the complete lack of support and information from Jetstar staff became increasingly apparent. To make matters worse, the on duty manager was extremely rude and dismissive, responding to our requests with a cold “no” to every question posed.  Furthermore, the lack of any form of compensation or apology for the significant inconvenience caused by the eight-hour delay only added to the frustration and disappointment. Jetstar does not appear to be concerned about the impact of delays on customers’ plans, schedules and overall travel experience."

In following this further we now find out that we are further  delayed until 5.00am. Jetstar have made no attempt to contact us at all, but every airline “flight site” knows about our miserable Jetstar treatment and the delays we are being forced to endure. We are miserable at the thought of 10 Jetstar hours in Ho Chi Minh airport."

Manila-Singapore was on time while Singapore-Manila was delayed due to air traffic congestion. This is our second time to fly with Jetstar Asia and it is still the same, good service, attentive and friendly flight attendants, comfortable seating, and good food (pre-ordered). No IFE nor news papers so better download your favorite movie or bring your own reading materials before boarding. I downloaded mine. For travellers with infant like us, please note that there are no available seats with bassinet but there is in the toilet. The front row seats can be a good place for with infants as it has a bigger space but with additional cost. No issues on our check-in luggage as we purchased 20 kg each at affordable price. Two hand-carries were allowed for us (7 kg each), one for our baby’s diaper bag and one for the standard luggage-size for Jetstar hand-carries. Knowing the limitations or do’s and don’t’s in a low-cost carriers makes the flight hassle-free, smooth, and fun. I would hihgly recommend this airline to our family and friends."
Alessandro,"May 8, 2018",Jetstar Asia,5.0,Flew Economy Class,8.0,4,5,4,0,,,0,Yes,"I flew on Jetstar Asia flight 722 from Osaka to Singapore via Taipei on April 28th 2018. Aircraft was a 6 years old Airbus A320-232 (reg: 9V-JSM). Me and my wife bought the extra leg room seats on the website cause we were scared we were not gonna be comfortable on such a small plane for such a “long” flight.. We were seated on the emergency exit row (13). Flight attendant fully explained the safety procedures related to the seat. The seat was comfortabale and wide enough for a big person (as I am). Leg room was more than enough and it seemed decent even in the seats that didn’t have extra space (but I have not tried so I can’t say for sure). The flight was on time and smooth. The layover in Taipei is annoying cause passangeres continuing to Singapore have to get off the plane, get a “re-boarding card”, go through security and go back to the gate for boarding. It seems a little odd. This is my only negative comment on the flight. On a good note, this means the plane gets cleaned, which is always a nice thing. Having flown numerous times on low-cost carriers in Europe such as Ryanair and Easyjet, I have to say that my experience withJetstar Asia was positive. There’s no (free) food or entertainment as this is a low cost. Know this and be prepared: bring magazines, books and snacks and you’ll be more than fine."

After much argument we were given a flight to Bali and then from Bali to Melbourne after a five hour wait at Bali airport.  We were not provided with refreshments from Singapore to Bali even though our original flight included meals.  Our flight from Bali to Melbourne was delayed twice so we spent nine hours in Bali airport, arriving in Melbourne about 3.15 am when there were no available trains from Southern Cross station.

Bryan,"April 25, 2016",Jetstar Asia,5.0,Flew Economy,1.0,0,3,3,1,,,1,No,I no longer fly Jetstar Asia – I simply cannot rely upon them to get me anywhere on time. They cancel or delay flights – especially in the afternoons and evenings – usually on some pret4ence of “operational challenges”. I believe that they arbitrarily cancel flights that are not full or economic.

It was a very poor experience throughout Vietnam on the numerous Jetstar flights we had booked well in advance, customer service was equally uninterested in addressing the many problems that we were confronted with enroute. Sadly our experience with Jetstar Asia to Siem Reap reinforced their negative attitude towards customers and we will never travel through Asia with this airline again, other numerous experiences with similar style airlines in Asia were delightful. Would not use Jetstar Asia again or recommend."

No queues, pl sty of staff and check in kiosks. A great experience for a low cost carrier."
Karl,"January 31, 2016",Jetstar Asia,5.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,4,0,,,1,No,"I booked this flight Siem Reap-Sin for myself and family but thought I was booking a Jetstar plane which I have flown on many times before, however it was an old Valuair plane which Jetstar acquired when they bought out the Valuair company. You can see the small Valuair insignia on the plane which has been repainted with Jetstar colours. Once aboard I thought I was on candid camera as the seat base was almost touching the back of the seat in front and I honestly didn’t know how I was going to fit between to even sit down. After squeezing my legs through I sat down with my knees pressed hard against the seat in front (I am 6ft 2″)My wifes knees were just touching and she is 5ft 7″. I was in pain the entire 2.5 hr flight. The pre paid meal came out it was not edible as it seemed like it was the 4th time reheated with un chewable rice and meat that didn’t taste right although bland. The staff were friendly enough but that has put me off flying Jetstar in Asia in case its an old Valuair plane. My next flight was with Tigerair and this seemed like business class to me after the flight I’d just had on Jetstar Valuair, Tiger had plenty of knee room."

Kudos to Jetstar Asia as they managed to fly-in to MNL (planes coming from SG) and fly-out from MNL to KIX given the small window for taking-off and landing imposed at NAIA then.  It was our first time with this airline and we will fly with it again.  My wife was able to purchase a buy-one-take-one ticket and it was a big savings for us.  Jetstar’s seat pitch and leg room is bigger compared to the other low-cost airline which I have been flew before.  The cabin is clean and the temperature is just enough for a comfortable sleep.  The crew are all nice and I like very much how they do the safety demonstration.   It was executed in a manner (not in a hurry) that all on-board the plane have enough time to listen and understand it.  Arriving at KIX, it was a smooth landing. EDITORS COMMENT: Thanks for the great feedback – they do have more legroom you’re right!"
John,"January 24, 2017",Jetstar Japan,6.3,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,4,0,,,0,Yes,I’ve flow Jetstar many times in Japan.  Never had any issue but best to understand the rules of any airline you fly.  Things go wrong sometimes.  Insurance is useful.
Elizabeth,"June 16, 2014",Jetstar Japan,6.3,Flew Economy,0.0,1,3,1,0,,,0,No,"Osaka Kansai Airport to Naha, Okinawa airport. Do not use Jetstar. The service was horrible. Website declined my card so I went to another airline who would accept my debit card. (had the funds) Four days later they charged my card. I called to cancel because I already bought tickets from another  airline and they told me that it was non refundable. When I explained that my card was declined and I never received a confirmation, they said “You might not have received the confirmation, but we did. So take it or leave it”.  When I tried to name change because the group members changed, they wanted to charge twice the value of the ticket purchased. I sent in a complaint to the website and got a response over a week later from someone saying the website often malfunctions during busy times of the year but still would not refund my money and that it was an unfortunate mistake This airline is absolutely horrible and the customer service is the worst. My first experience with Japanese customer service representative and they were unpleasant and not helpful.  I will never use it again. Please use another airline."
Eric,"March 18, 2014",Jetstar Japan,6.3,Flew Economy,10.0,4,4,5,0,,,5,Yes,"I flew from Kansai Osaka to Naha Okinawa. The planes were new, great service and alot cheaper than other airlines servicing Okinawa."
Sven,"February 13, 2020",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy Class,3.0,2,2,3,0,4,3,0,No,"The super annoying thing about Jetstar is that they change departure times frequently. And it’s never to your advantage. We had to get up much earlier on my outbound flight, and the return flight departure time was changed 4 times (we had to change our travel plans, actually). But when you talk to them, all they have is like a AI assistant chat (basically, you’re talking to a robot) that only offers generic phrases/apologies. Also, I’m 1,83 (6’1′), which isn’t huge, but there’s no legroom for me whatsoever. The outbound flight was kinda empty, but they still herded passengers together in two clusters, instead of giving people a little more room."
Thuy,"December 25, 2019",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,2,2,3,3,2,No,"I almost go for the flight and got the flight cancellation just 30 minutes before departure time. No time enough for me to arrange my schedule and no extra flight replacement for that, the other flights are so long away in the day and I almost cancelled my plan. Reimbursement is not enough for booking another flight. Terrible experience. Jetstar is deserved to be the worst airline in the world."
Becky,"January 12, 2019",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,1,,,2,No,"If you think you’re going to save a few dollars with cheap tickets, think again. This airline will TOTALLY RUIN YOUR HOLIDAY! They are really rough with the luggage and broke my $600 Samsonite suitcase and snapped one of the wheels right off!! I immediately alerted ground staff upon picking it up off the carousel and logged a report – they wanted me to sign a document that said I’d accept about USD $6 as full and final settlement. WTF?!? Then they sent me an email saying, sorry, that’s all we can offer you and “We do hope you can sympathize with us.” Why would I sympathize with an airline that has damaged my luggage and refused to replace it?? I almost missed my connecting flight because they took 45 mins to fill in 3 forms – which got me no where! I’ll never fly with them again, once is enough."
Carmela,"January 27, 2018",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,0,,,0,Yes,Booked Hanoi to Danang and Danang to Ho Chi Minh. Both aircrafts were new and very clean. Booked Starter plus bundle so therefore had no issues with luggage or seating. Did not book or buy and food as only 1 hour flight. no delays on first flight actually arrived early into Danang. 2nd flight was 1 hour late but was immediately aware of this at check in. Staff all very friendly. I especially liked that Jetstar staff check that you have the correct luggage when leaving the airports which can delay you a bit but ensures that you have not taken somebody elses suitcase.
I,"November 24, 2017",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,2,1,2,,,2,No,Probably the worst airline I have ever flown on. They cancelled our connecting flight and moved us to a flight 5 hours later (which apparently they often do when they don’t have enough passengers on their earlier flight). We complained about having a 1 hour layover changed to a 5 hour layover and asked for some compensation. After a 30 min discussion they reluctantly agreed. When we went to board our flight they took our tickets and ripped them up and said that we had cancelled our flight and could no longer fly and would throw our baggage off the flight. NEVER FLY WITH JETSTAR. It is the worst customer experience I have had on an airline and I have travelled with many airlines across most continents.
Bronwyn,"November 13, 2015",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy,1.0,4,0,1,0,,,0,No,Jet Star Pacific (BL) – warning….. I will not book them again based on their customer service repsonse – When BL cancel their flights they instruct passengers to come to the counter and they will walk them over the the alternative airlines they re booked…. BUT they do not seem to assist their passengers  but leave them to flounder around .Better service was obtained when going directly to Vietnam Airlines.Customer services offer USD 9  yes single digit 9 as compensation – that buys 2 cups of coffee. This is an absolute insult…..I agree with Darrell W who posted on 28 September 2013 on trip advisor  – seems nothing changes  in 2 years ?
Sam,"January 20, 2015",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy,1.0,2,1,2,0,,,0,No,"I had no idea this was Vietnam’s worst budget airline with a 100% delay rate when I booked this ticket. I had never heard of this airline. I had booked a flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City that was scheduled to leave at 10:45PM. The flight was delayed until 12:15AM, but certainly didn’t leave at that time. Everything was a mess. They treated their (mostly Vietnamese) clientele extremely rudely and didn’t seem to care about them. This was true at the service desk, gate, and onboard the plane. There may have been one or two employees who were decent people but the rest totally sucked."
nini,"February 19, 2014",Jetstar Pacific,2.3,Flew Economy,0.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I booked a flight with Jetstar Pacific airlines for the 15th of February 2014, from Ho Chi Minh to Danang, and it was the worst flight experience of my life. I was told few days before my departure that it is not a good company, but too late, we just had to wait for the departure time. That day, we were supposed to fly around 1pm, and at the checking counter we were told that the flight has 3 hours delay! Ho surprise, they gave us an IOU of 14$ per person for our next purchase within 3 monthes, and free diner ticket… Then in the afternoon before going to the airport, we called the company, and have been told that there is 3 other hours of delay!! Instead of waiting and not being sure that we will fly that day, we try to get our ticket back, and fly with another company, much more professional!"
Dana,"December 23, 2016",Jin Air,1.0,Flew Economy,1.0,3,3,1,0,,,3,No,The flight to Laos with Jin Air was fine. The lack of customer service when I was leaving inspired me to review.
David,"August 29, 2015",Juneyao Airlines,8.0,Flew Economy,8.0,4,4,4,0,,,3,Yes,I have only flown with Juneyao in China and they were efficient and pleasant to deal with. No problems. Comfortable seats. Recommended in China.
Bilal,"March 4, 2023",Kam Air,6.6,Flew Economy Class,9.0,2,5,3,1,5,5,5,Yes,I was traveling from Kuwait City to Kabul on 23 june 2022 and believe me it was my best and safe flight and this flight was having no delays and the seats and tables were cleaned before we board the flight and pretty much good legroom 30’ inches that’s above average and the staff was friendly and the plane was B737-300 which is safe plane in history and the take off and landing was much much better than all airlines and the food was pretty good you get option between meet rice and chicken rice and there is vegetarian option to get salads i would give 9/10
Quyash,"January 23, 2022",Kam Air,6.6,Flew Economy Class,3.0,2,4,3,2,4,4,3,No,"It is a mafia airline. Scheduling flight for 3pm Mazar e Sharif to Kabul, aircraft flies 4pm from Delhi to Mazar. Flight is taking of from Mazar to Kabul at 7 pm. But no body telling anything. Flies with up to 20 most of issues, but it’s hiding by captain. Because of registering, captain may terminated. Also tickets are too high and facilities are less quality."
khalid,"July 4, 2020",Kam Air,6.6,Flew Economy Class,10.0,4,4,5,3,5,4,4,Yes,"I had a flight from Delhi to Kabul, I had a great experience the cabin crew was really friendly and the food was good too."
khalid,"July 2, 2020",Kam Air,6.6,Flew Economy Class,10.0,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,Yes,Kam Air is the best airline in Afghanistan with great hospitality.
Mohammad Mansoor,"January 12, 2019",Kam Air,6.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,1,1,3,,,3,No,"To ALL respected Viewers! I have a very bad experience with service, sets, breakfast…etc please if you are travelling to Afghanistan, please don’t book a set with KAM air airline. BR, Mansoor"
Hisham,"May 29, 2021",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"KENYA AIRWAYS THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF ONBOARD, ON-GROUND BACK OFFICE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IN DUBAI OFFICE AND NAIROBI KENYA."
Amy,"October 4, 2019",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,No,"Kenya Airways is absolute garbage and I don’t know how they are still in business. What a ripoff! I paid for business class roundtrip, my return flight was delayed until 2:30 am and then cancelled, I was stranded for one night in Nairobi and then another night in New York, and then they NEVER ACTUALLY BOOKED MY CONNECTING FLIGHT SO I DIDN’T EVEN HAVE A TICKET HOME!!! Yet they swore the entire time that I had a ticket. I have tried for a month to get a refund and they won’t respond. The customer service is routed through a call center in India that is absolutely worthless. I tried calling their home office in Nairobi (no toll free number so incurred international charges) and got hung up on before anyone could help me. Twice. Emails are ignored. I am by far not the only one having these problems, either. BELIEVE ME, THE NON-STOP FROM JFK TO NBO IS NOT WORTH THIS!!! USE ANOTHER AIRLINE!"
Nigel,"July 16, 2019",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,No,Not recommended at all. Everything that can go wrong will probably go wrong. The staff are arrogant. They treat you like sh!t and when you seek assistance they are arrogant and incompetent. Had a bad experience with my family. Sent to the wrong place for my bulk baggage. Wasted my time. and so on. For what?  Avoid the pain and fly with a normal airline.

Peter,"January 9, 2019",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,3,,,3,No,"Kenya Airways – Factor in Ransom Payments I was super excited to travel to Zimbabwe and see Africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in Harare. My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding. After a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to the States with Kenya Airways. The attendant there helpfully let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, given my presence in Zimbabwe, and would very much like to return home, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, which typically include a flight home, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded ransom payments to let me out of the sweltering hot airport onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes. 16 hours later, having missed every single flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 “penalty,” or really, the ransom payment, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. At this point I had resigned myself to the fact I had probably died and was in some new circle of airline hell, but fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice. All in all, I wound up spending nearly four days total in airplanes and airports, racking up international phone charges, and nearly doubling the cost of my Kenya Airways ticket. Kenya Airways, the Pride of Africa."
Jameson,"October 25, 2018",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,4,1,3,,,3,No,"On July 2, my wife and I were scheduled to fly NBO-LHR on Kenya Airways, then on to the United States on Delta. I am a US citizen and my wife is a Kenyan citizen with a US permanent resident card (aka “green card”). All went smoothly until the agent checking paperwork at the gate immediately prior to boarding denied boarding to my wife based on the idea a transit visa was required in the UK, when in fact no transit visa is needed for our situation. To make matters worse, when my wife returned to the ticket counter for further assistance (as instructed by the gate agent), she was told there was nothing they could do for her and that she would need to purchase an entirely new ticket. She purchased a one way ticket on KLM for $1550. Of course I immediately filed a complaint with Kenya Airways and insisted on reimbursement. After numerous inquiries into the status of my complaint, and being told an investigation was ongoing, I finally received an email on October 4 in which Kenya Airways admitted the situation was entirely their fault. They offered $300 compensation. After several more emails back and forth, I’ve concluded they will never make things right and accepted their $300 offer. It’s impossible to argue with an airline headquartered in a developing country with no real consequences for appalling customer service. Their 787 aircraft are nice (does any airline have a 787 which isn’t nice?) but I would stay far away from Kenya Airways. You never know what sort of shenanigans they will pull and there is no way to hold them accountable after the fact."
Akshey,"February 12, 2018",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,2,2,,,1,No,"I Will never fly with Kenya Airways again! Or a heads up for anyone who is daft enough to fly Kenya Airways. They call themselves the Pride of Africa! I would like to challenge that and say they are the hustlers of Africa They have left me stranded in Kenya and put a suspension on the last leg of my flight due to me missing one leg of my domestic internal flights. Even though I have fairly paid for all my seat on all the connecting flights. Speaking of the unhelpful customer services. I spent 30 mins on the phone, only to be placed on hold and eventually cut off with the issue unresolved. I then decided to go to the main office in Nairobi in hopes that something could be appeased only to find out that my only option is to book a new flight. My primary advice would be, never to fly with Kenya Airways, they have such nonsensical and unfair policies. If you are forced to fly Kenya Airways remember to take all you’re connecting flights and if you miss it for any unfortunate circumstance notify the airline."
maeva,"August 16, 2017",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,3,,,2,No,"If we can sometimes have stopovers in the flights we take in some companies, Kenya airways has been the worst.They arrived at 6pm and were promised a plane for 11pm but until 2am they had to wait until finally they were told that the plane would not be there.We then disembarked them to the hotel, but considering the great distance with the hotel and the great security measures, they arrived at 5am at this hotel. Then, at 6:00 AM, they dared to wake them up, which left them an hour of rest (knowing that an 80-year-old grandmother traveled alone, with no way to contact her family, her fault? Not, I believe rather in a masthead of the company).Arriving back to the airport, they had to wait more than normal. If the plane was to take off at 11 am, they left at 8:30 pm. And this without many problems and great indifference of the company for the obligations of their users. It’s incredible, they had to go from service to duty to ask them to share them in planes, because NO, their company was asking them to wait very wisely as sheep as something happens. (It is known that because of this delay, other users have missed other flights to Paris, in correspondence)."
bernard,"August 16, 2017",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,3.0,3,2,3,4,,,3,No,Delayed for hours in dubai… no explanation. No they dont care wether you will miss you next flight or get late for appointment. The are only good for free unlimited alcohol. They get you drunk so that youll forget about their shitty services and the ever lazy and drunk crews
Anthony,"March 4, 2017",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,5,3,,,3,Yes,That was the first time I was flying! But was a nice experience (with what the pilot said was “Embraer 190”). We also experienced flying through “turbulence” before landing in Kisumu on 9.12.2016 from Mombasa.   I would love to travel a longer distance in the future. Thank you very much for doing a good job to your customers. I wish you well in the future.
Suzanne,"September 6, 2016",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,0,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Kenya Airways let us fly on their partner airline Precision Air from Nairobi to Zanzibar without informing us our ticket was invalid. They let us fly without a ticket! We only discovered we had flown without a ticket when we tried to get back from Zanzibar and there was no record of our booking. We had to pay an exorbitant amount (more than the original return flight) for a one way trip Zanzibar to Nairobi.  Then a week later when as we boarded our flight home to London, Kenya Airways stopped us at the boarding gate demanding  $720 for the flight they had mistakenly let us on or else they’d cancel our London flights and strand us in Nairobi. This was nothing more than extortion. The Precision Air flight was a separate booking and completed unrelated. Their claim was ridiculous as their original mistake cost us far more in lost time, extra hotels and flights than they extorted from us. It was nothing more than blackmail at the boarding gate. Never in all our years had something like this happened. We will never fly Kenya Airways again and I feel bad for the country that its national carrier is such a disgrace, especially when they so desperately need tourists to return. Zero stars."
Yi-Chia,"August 29, 2016",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"It’s the worst airline I’ve ever taken. The flight delayed for 12 hours, but the staff did not tell us until the last moment. They asked us to go to their scheduled connecting hotel by shuttles, but the coming shuttle was broken! We waited in the freezing night for 5 hours, but Kenya Airways refused to pay for taxi or any basic supplies including water.  The staff were mean and cold. Next day, they did not tell us about the flight, and the connecting flight was still determined. I couldn’t imagine any worse experience!  Unresponsible, unreliable, and unforgivable."
Andrew,"January 9, 2015",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Business,7.0,4,4,5,3,,,4,Yes,"I fly regularly on KQ as an alternative to KLM.  On this occasion I flew from Nairobi to Charles de Gaulle, Paris on the 787 Dreamliner.  I was quite happy with most aspects of the flight – punctuality, catering, baggage handling, in-flight service were perfectly adequate.  It’s not the most comfortable cabin layout I have used but the plane is new so everything was in good condition and I was able to work throughout the flight.  When Kenya Airlines flies it is fine, the problems start when they cancel flights then their passenger handling is frankly awful."
Terry,"January 5, 2015",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,2,,,1,No,"How laughable when I see Kenya airlines has all 10 of 10 ratings.  Just know that if your flight gets cancelled you will be treated horribly.  All airlines have problems resulting in cancellations but how Kenya Airlines handles it is totally inappropriate.  I am a woman traveling with a 5 yer old child.  Our flight was cancelled and we were kept at the airport for 8 hours before they told us we would have to return the next day.  A 5 year old child was thus kept a the airport until midnight.  We were offered no explanation, no accurate information of what to expect, no food, no water.   This was a truly horrible experience.  I had flown with Kenya Airlines a total of 7 round trip flights in 4 months for thousands of dollars, so what I am saying is this show they treat their good customers.  I think if you are traveling with family or traveling with children, you should think twice before choosing Kenya Airways and choose a more family friendly airline."
Yan,"December 4, 2014",Kenya Airways,4.0,Flew Economy,10.0,4,5,4,4,,,4,Yes,"Flew NBO-CDG on the 787 , Brand new Aircraft excellent recline and pitch.

Silvia,"May 9, 2023",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,3,1,1,2,No,"KLM is now consistently my worst travel experience airline! Their staff do not know the applicable benefits for each of their membership levels. It clearly states on their website that silver flying blue members have priority lanes. However, every time I use one, I am told extremely rudely that I am not allowed to use priority lanes. In February 2023 KLM left us stranded in Tanzania for 24 hours due to allegedly security threats. The official Dutch foreign ministry advice for travelling reported no alerts for the area. After I (finally!) returned home, I filed a claim to KLM for compensation which was denied with no explanations. Then I filed a claim for reimbursement of expenses (1 extra day at the hotel and 1 extra day at Schiphol parking) I only received a refund for the hotel. I asked at least 25 times (really not joking here!) to KLM via all the channels they have why I didn’t receive a refund for the parking. After 3 months I am still awaiting for a reply that will obviously never come! Incredibly rude, utterly stupid and I would expect much more from an airline such as KLM."
Niels,"March 4, 2023",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,0,No,"Last October I boarded a KLM flight from Amsterdam to LAX . After finally getting to my assigned seat , and getting seated comfortably, the Head Flight Attendant approached me  and demanded that I change my seat to accommodate another passengers convenience! I state again she did not ask me to relocate to a different seat ! She demanded that I relocate. The Flight Attendant (She) was rude and disrespectful and could care less as to my feeling. I contacted KLM and as of this date has not contacted me. I give a thumbs down to KLM! I will never fly KLM willingly."
Angelique,"November 29, 2022",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"My son booked a flight in March to travel to  SA from the UK in June at  £598.27. Due to a system error  payment was not processed and he didn”t receive confirmation of the flight,  he assumed that the flight had not been processed. He booked a second flight at the same cost and received confirmation. The following day he ‘noted that he had TWO flights and funds had been deducted for BOTH, so he cancelled the one. Again, a cancellation confirmation was not processed. So, he cancelled the second flight thinking that he still had the first. Three weeks before his flight to SA on checking Flying Blue – he had NO flights. BOTH were cancelled. After MUCH hassle he spoke to a consultant who informed him that he would have to rebook a flight at  £1592.77 (TRIPLE the price). He had to fork it out to get home and KLM just shrugged their shoulders. It is truly outrageous – due to KLM’s system glitches, we had to carry the cost of  £998.50. In rand that is a huge sum and we have heard NOTHING from KLM in terms of compensation."
Heather,"June 21, 2022",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,Missed the flight and got the run around because of their non existent customer service. Social media links don’t actually solve peoples’ problems. Won’t honour return flight. Will cost thousands to rebook. Abysmal company. Will be sure to tell everyone I know never to book with them because of their customer service.
meital,"April 30, 2022",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,4.0,1,3,4,1,3,1,1,No,"When purchasing flight tickets, we also purchased the option of early check-in, in order to save waiting times at the port and so that we will be able to sit together during the flights. On the first flight, we tried for hours to check in, but their website crashed and we almost gave up – suddenly the request was accepted – after so many attempts. On the way back, we were no longer so lucky – dozens of attempts, including in the very late hours of night and hours of trying to get them by phone – were to no avail. Desperate and disappointed, we arrived about four and a half hours before the flight. It didn’t help either – we were split up in seats on the plane. we contacted KLM for a refund for purchasing a service we did not completely  receive, they replied: “We apologize for the malfunction, we will pass the details to the technical staff to prevent future malfunctions, we will not be able to make a refund because on the first flight you managed to check in”. in short, When buying refrigerator, you expect to get a refrigerator and not a minibar!"
Ivan,"November 24, 2021",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,2,4,3,5,Yes,"I fly KLM very often and my last flight was marked by the extreme politeness and quality of service. After talking a bit to cabin crew they gave me some sandwiches (love their cheese) and some gifts from an airline at the disembarking. Good food, good legroom for Europe, cabin crew is always polite and customer support is also good. I was able to change departure airport even to over country (LIN instead of ZRH). while with most airlines it is problematical even to change to other airport within same country. Check-in in some airports (example: SVO, BUD, LIN) is a bit too long and without Flying Blue silver it would have been not the best experience. Good price for money except high season and you can also check in hand luggage."
MD Farid Faidzal,"February 19, 2021",Klm,4.9,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,Yes,"I only fly with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to Jakarta from Kuala Lumpur frequently. Although its a 4pm 1 flight per day out of KUL then 6pm 1 flight a day to KUL from Jakarta, KLM has given me one of the best flight services i’ve been in. From the check-in process at KLIA where i usually travel in Business Class, to their KLM lounge, their fun in-flight entertainment although it was only a short 2 hours trip, the delicious in-flight meals with few selections to choose from, the friendly cabin crew who always happy to assist me, business class comforts & the smooth flights back & fourth, simply was magnificent! What i love most about KLM flight was…either they will be ahead of the scheduled arrival times or their early departure from their schedule departure time….both were done by the flight crew in the comfort zone of their World Business Class"

Benard,"December 16, 2020",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,2,2,4,1,1,2,No,KLM is in business. They have their own covid testing center called KLM HEALTH SERVICES at the schiphol airport and they force almost everybody take a covid test there even with a test from other countries over minor excuses. Forced a mom to stay 3 days for her to get covid test for a 4 month old baby. I stayed at the airport too for 3 days bc my results didn’t have time. The one I took in their center didn’t have time off test too.

Our cruise was cancelled due to the corona virus and we tried to change our tickets.  Due to KLM’s clumsy online forms, we inadvertently cancelled the tickets. When we spoke to KLM customer service, they REFUSED to reinstate or change the ticket, basically stealing almost $1,000 in ticket price. These guys are THIEVES. DON’T EVER BOOK A FLIGHT ON KLM!!!"
Joyce,"January 15, 2020",Klm,4.9,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"Our bags did not leave with us from Schipol (Amsterdam) to London.  KLM dealt with it by acknowledging this electronically, notifying us electronically of when our bags arrived in London (on the same night as our arrival) and reassuring us that our bags would be couriered to us at our London accommodation between specific times. It all went exactly as KLM  & the courier had indicated. Other aspects of the flight was very good, the food was great, good variety of beverages offered with meals and the toilets were always clean and tidy onboard also. They even provide a sandwich snack  & hot/cold drinks for short haul between Amsterdam and London, Lovely all round. Recommended. Meal service began at our row 30 so no waiting around. Thanks KLM"
Maureen,"January 13, 2020",Klm,4.9,Flew Business Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Business class service at connecting airports was severely lacking- no one was there to help/direct me when plane was late for connection- l was told to run- a twenty minute run to another gate at Amsterdam, baggage was delayed for two days…. and so much more. However the after fight customer care is even worse- almost six months later lm still trying to get a reply to my complaint. The website sends you round in a loop. I used messenger as directed only to be told a number of times that complaints are very high and to be patient. When l did get a response they had ignored many of my complaint points and closed my complaint- leaving it very difficult to appeal- l had to start the whole process again. Worst airline service l have ever experienced."

Upon leaving the aircraft, I sought help from crew staff.  They were quick to refer me to the airport website and the airline website before ushering me off.   Later confirmed that the airport was in possession of my wallet but needed some assistance or advice retrieving it.  I called their customer service hotline which was received by an agent from the ticketing office in Malaysia, who told me that there was nothing they would do.  The agent didn’t have the knowledge or capacity to be of any assistance, but refused to let me speak to other staff in the airline who might have more of a clue.   The overwhelming impression is that their staff are only willing to do the bare minimum.   The airline is fine for getting from point A to B, but do not expect their staff to be of any help if you need it. Also, customer support seems to ignores emails or are extremely slow at replying."

A 7 hour layover in Incheon unpleasant as 2 lounges both overcrowded, with limited and poor quality food options. Getting a shower was almost impossible as no-one could be found to arrange a cubicle for a long time. Needed to return to Sydney early due to family illness at home. They refused to alter our tickets to an earlier date without adding 3,000 per ticket x 3 as we’d bought them cheap at 5500 each, or about 16,500. No empathy or consideration given to our plight so never again will we fly them to Europe."
RAVI,"February 18, 2018",Korean Air,7.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,4,3,3,,,2,No,"It was an international travel from Fukuoka (Japan) to Delhi (India) via Seoul (South Korea) by Korean Air. Due to the bad weather condition, the airline was kept on postponing the estimated time of departure in Fukuoka (Japan) Airport. The flight from Fukuoka to Seoul was 5:30 hours delayed approximately. During that time the staff at Fukuoka airport provided a can of coffee and nothing else. Anyway, I was worried since I needed to board another Korean Air flight from Seoul to Delhi. Unfortunately, I couldn’t board that flight. I contacted airlines staff and the staff suggested me to take the next day flight from Seoul to Delhi. The staff happily showed incapability to provide any lounge/hotel for one night stay as well. I was supposed to reach Seoul in afternoon but landed in the late evening. I was completely exhausted and hungry also knowing that I needed to spend one night and a day until afternoon (15 hours approximately) before boarding the flight to Delhi. Now, the flight to Delhi was kept on postponing. During this time period, I contacted airport inquiry and tired to contact airline staff but couldn’t find the airline staff in various attempts. Not to mention that airlines didn’t provide any food since they didn’t bother to contact me at all. Note that the flight which was supposed to take off afternoon was finally rescheduled to 20:00 hours approximately which made my stay at Incheon Airport (Seoul) 24 hours approximately. It was indeed a pathetic experience and I was left with no energy. The airline should treat the passenger properly and also provide accommodation if flights are rescheduled. I would definitely not recommended Korean Airlines to anyone."
Achiraya,"December 12, 2017",Korean Air,7.8,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,4,1,1,,,1,No,"My husband booked my flight on Korean Airline because of the reputation for great customer service. My husband and I have previously had excellent service when we traveled in coach class. However, my entire flight in Prestige Class was very disappointing. The customer service by the flight attendants on all flights was below average. I was expecting alot more in Prestige Class. On previous flights, we have been treated much better in coach. I selected a noodle dish on KE 035 which was served with ice cubes floating in the bowl. I had to ask for water since the flight attendant rarely came by to ask if anything was needed. On my return (KE 036), I asked for bread but was told “no” since bread didn’t come with my choice of meal. The flight attendant later returned with bread. On flight KE 659, I had to ask for a bottle of water but was told the flight didn’t have bottled water. They served me a very small glass of water but didn’t come back to see if I needed more water…I HAD TO ASK. I find it appalling Korean Airline didn’t have bottled water. On the same flight, the meal I selected was not good so I ask if I could have the noodle dish. I was SHOCKED when the flight attendant brought me a bag of dried noodles and hot water. I don’t know what happened to the excellent customer service experienced on previous flights but my entire flight was not worth the money spent on my Prestige Class ticket. This will be the LAST time I will EVER book a flight on Korean Airline. Food was terrible, flight attendants were terrible, the entertainment consisted of very old movies and overall experience was absolutely terrible. My husband wasted the extra money spent on flying with your airline BUT NEVER AGAIN. Overall rating…less than 1 star. Additionally, the Korean Air lounge at Incheon Airport was absolutely disgusting."

Adele,"December 26, 2021",Kulula,3.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AIRLINE!!!!  We booked a domestic flight for our planned 3 week trip trip to south africa from Ireland. Covid meant our flights leaving Ireland was suspended. The customer service was horrendous – I received no reply to repeated messages and emails sent. They were not willing to refund the 200 euro spent. A friend in South Africa did get through to them eventually and the only option they gave my son and I was to pay more money to rebook flights within 5 months yet flights are still suspended??? This is not realistic nor is it helpful and quite appalling given that our inability to get to South Africa is completely out of our control. All other agents whom we booked with in South Africa kindly refunded our money. I would subsequently advice people not to book with this airline period given our negative experience overall.

We got there 20 min. before the counter was closing, but were told, that the flight had been overbooked. Everybody at or around the counter where hopelessly confused, inefficient, not very good at communicating to us or other costumers. Bottom line: After a lot of confusion and waiting around, we had to wait for two ours for the next flight. No compensation – just frustration. Returning from Cape Town with Mango Air was WAY better."
Steven,"November 15, 2016",Kulula,3.8,Flew Economy,5.0,3,3,1,0,,,2,No,"I booked a return flight from George SA to Johannesburg with Kulula online. Going from George everything was ok but on checking in a week later to return to George, we were told that because we missed the first flight (George to Johannesburg) we were taken off the system. They refused to help us any further unless we could proof we were on the flight. After unpacking all of our luggage, my wife found her boarding stub. All of this took more than an hour and I could not believe that in this modern age that some stupid system still excisted"
Dave,"July 17, 2015",Kulula,3.8,Flew Economy,5.0,3,2,3,0,,,3,No,"The flight was fine. My gripe is with the Kalula website and trying to book my ticket online. It is unbelievable! If I was the webmaster I would be embarrassed. One can spend hours trying to book a flight. Errors everywhere. Cannot process certain credit cards one day and then different one’s the next. Within 2 minutes the price of a particular flight varies from R650.00 to R1800.00.  I was told it was because of sudden availability changes.  Not true. I could see the seat availability as I had just reserved a seat minutes prior.  There were dozens of seats available. Very frustrating. And then they have the audacity to charge you R100.00 rand to call them up to book a flight because you cannot do it online.  This archaic web issue is not new.  It has been like this for years.  Kalula, get a grip!  If the birth certificates are not chasing your customers away, your website will."

The seats were comfortable and larger compared to some other airlines, and the cabin crew were friendly and welcomed the passengers beautifully. The food was delicious and the varieties were varied. The entertainment lacked some modernization, but it was good. For me, I recommend traveling on Kuwait Airways and trying it after the modernization of the fleet in recent years and its significant development."

We wrote a complaint mail to Kuwait Airways but till date no satisfactory response has been received by them. I will not recommend Kuwait Airways."

Tracey,"January 9, 2019",Kuwait Airways,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,2,1,1,,,1,No,"On arriving at Heathrow terminal 4 (1.17 hours before my flight departure) I was told by a rude and uneducated man who works for Kuwait Airways that my flight had closed. A Dan Adwani said I was too late to check in. He said the desk were checking in passengers (the people in the queue) for a later flight. He told me that I could not join the queue and I could not speak to another member of staff on the check in desk. I informed him that it was over an hour to my flight departure… therefore I was not late. He said I was, and that I needed to step aside, “go over there” waving his hand dismissively and book another ticket for a later flight. Most people with a hint of empathy can imagine that at this point I was upset and anxious as I weighed up both the financial implications due to purchasing another ticket, and the work implications as a result of arriving in Kuwait a day late and missing work. Therefore, I ignored this inept Kuwait Airways employee, and spoke to a woman on the check in desk. My attempts to reach her were comical as Dan Adwani attempted to block my path the whole way while raising his voice to bark orders at me. To my surprise, the woman at the desk informed me that my flight was open. Even more outrageously, everyone in the queue was getting on the same flight and the people joining the queue after I had arrived were also getting on the same flight. It was at this point I joined the line to check in. The unsavoury man, Dan Adwani, rushed over to what I later learned was his supervisors during my exchange with the woman behind the desk. He later returned at my side to inform me that he would “allow me” to check in, but the incident was my fault, I should have got there 1.20 hour before the departure time. It was a misunderstanding, but It was my fault! Needless to say, I was astounded! I complained to his line manager who was also very unprofessional and obviously his friend, so I have placed a formal written complaint with their superiors. I have never experienced such incompetence by an Airline. I would recommend other potential passengers consider if they really want to fly with this airline. The low star ratings and negative feedback from other passengers is reflective of the poor service they provide. The only positive in want was an experience that almost brought me to tears was a lovely woman, Munira, who checked me in. She was very effective and embodied excellent customer care. If Kuwait Airways recognised and promoted their good staff rather than allowing a clique of obnoxious inefficient people to rise to higher frontline positions, they might be able to start turning around the substandard service and negative feedback from their customers."
RAJ,"October 8, 2018",Kuwait Airways,3.3,Flew Economy Class,3.0,3,4,2,1,,,1,No,"THE PLANE WAS OLD (THE ARM-RESTS STILL HAD ASH TRAYS & CIGARETTE HOLDERS), NO IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT AND UNPLEASANT STAFF.

Alan,"July 3, 2017",Kuwait Airways,3.3,Flew Economy,3.0,2,3,3,1,,,2,No,"This airline doesn’t even warrant one star. The worst airline I have ever flown. The flight from London was ok, but nothing special. At least it was on a new plane. The main issue was there was no entertainment on our flights from Kuwait to Manila return, and when we complained about it, we were told it’s always like that. Not acceptable!!! We also complained about the lack of food and especially drinks. We were told there is a Galaxy service which we found out at the end of the flight means it’s self service. The crew need to explain this better. Lastly the crew. Some were ok, but some also were cold and it seemed they didn’t want to be there. Maybe they just didn’t want to work for this airline. As other airlines have moved on with regards to technology and customer experience, sadly Kuwait Airways has been left in the mid 1990s. I will never fly this airline again and cannot recommend them one little bit."

I would never recommend anybody to travel with Kuwait airways ever because of its crappy performance. On every step of the journey, I have experienced poorest performance. The Kuwait airways haven’t failed to disappoint me on every location of the Journey.  On every step of the journey and I have seen crap happening. If Kuwait airways do not know how to run an airline may be they should close it before they put somebody’s life in danger."

In our outbound and inbound travel on all the flights none of the entertainment systems was working and we were not even given a blanket for our kid because the flight attendant said they have ran out of blankets. I have travelled in kuwait airways in the same route about five years back and your entertainment systems were not working at that time either. It looks like you know in none of your flights entertainment systems are not working and you are using these crap flights without resolving these issues. I would never ever book a ticket in kuwait airways in the future.
Jonah,"December 20, 2018",Lam,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,0,,,3,No,"We took four flights with this so called airline over the course of 5 days. These amounted to a return from Johannesburg to Maputo and return domestic flights from Maputo to Vilanculos. None of the flights were remotely on time and one, after a delay of some 5 hours was cancelled. For me this was the defining moment of LAM in which their management hadn’t a clue what was going on much less the skills to communicate at least the fact of a delay to passengers. At the point of cancellation they seemed to have appointed a 14 year old girl to scribble out a few vouchers and shepherd us onto a bus that took us to a third rate hotel for overnight. We only learned of the pick up time next day from a fellow passenger who was in contact with a friend who worked for the airline. In the event the bus to the airport turned up nearly an hour late and took a circuitous route to the airport due to having to drop off the drivers wife at the bust station. Of course we needn’t have worried about being late to the airport as the plane was …you’ve guessed it…delayed! LAM is extensively referred to as LATE AND MAYBE and worse still even the staff seem to accept this. On each of our flights, there were tedious problems with the airline’s computer system that delayed things at check in and on three of these, our boarding cards were hand written. Quaint it might be but there is no place for such nonsense in modern aviation. I’ve since heard tales from enough sources to support credibility that senior managers often treat aircraft as their personal planes and have rerouted scheduled flights to get themselves around the country. Frankly this airline is a shambles and if it wasn’t heavily subsidised by the Mozambican taxpayers would have gone bust long ago. Yes they are cheap but I for one will never trust them again. You certainly get what you pay for with LAM and sadly often less even than that."
Mike,"May 30, 2017",Lam,3.3,Flew Economy,2.0,1,2,2,0,,,2,No,"Flew from Villankulo to Jo’Berg via Inhamban. Plane was late to arrive in Villankulo with no communication to passengers. Once plane arrived, after a significant amount of time, we were told the airplane was broken. Waited two hours while mechanic was flown in from Maputo. Took mechanic another 2+ hours to fix plane. Took off with sun going down. Landed at Inhamban in the dark in the rain (airport not set up for instrument landings). Surprised to see the runway had no landing lights, but, rather, someone had lit a small number of torches (think citronella candles) on either side of the runway. Picked up passengers in Inhambane. Took off again for Jo’Berg in pitch black (again using only torches for runway light). Hit turbulence shortly after takeoff. Interior lights on airplane began to flicker on and off. Mechanic — who had remained with the flight since Villankulo — came storming from the back of the plane into the cockpit, which alarmed passengers. Landed in Jo’Berg 6+ hours late. Missed connection to Cape Town. Was told by airline rep that LAM would handle rebooking. That never happened. Customer service closed. Had to pay $600 for new flights. Lost entire day of Honeymoon."

They have send me a e-mail a week before to say this is delayed and will only depart at 16h10, that was still okay. The day when I had to fly, I checked in at about 14h15 and went through passport control becuse my flight was suppose to leave at 16h10 (that was the delay time stated) and waited for friends to come through that was on the same flight. Only to hear later they can’t check in because the flight is only leaving at 19h10. When I asked to move my return date 2 days on or even just 1 day, because I have wasted a day already with this whole delay thing and plans were down the drain. They charged me more than what my ticket cost initially. If you want to be on time don’t fly this airline, you will save your self alot of money!"

The airline has clearly gone to great lengths to train staff and pilots.  Equipment and departure lounge in Luang Prabang all new.  I would definitely fly Lao again.  Good value for money. //  Downsides:  some staff have a low level of English and the Immigration Counters have almost no English and are ineffficient and error-prone.

The flight Schedule changed but they forget to send the update and i had to wait my flight 5 hours at the airport without any excuse or compensation from the company. 3 – they are not at the good technical level : no possible to review online your booking and no online checkin  – if they had these standard features : i will have learn the flight update 4 – their staff are very slow for checkin at the airport and inefficient 5 – you don’t feel safe on board But the good new is you can avoid Lao Airlines : many flights from thai, vietnamese, cambodia, malaysian airlines"

Only the pilot said sorry when we prepared to take off! Imagine…the flight was even delayed for 15 minutes while the air hostess and other Laser employees inquired about two missing passengers! All this after the flight was four hours late! Laser don’t have any care in the world for passengers and their time. The airline employees should be bilingual (Counter and Air Hostess).

We paid extra money for direct flights, however, soon after buying the flights, we got an email that the return trip between Buenos Aires and Santiago was changed via Sao Paulo, with a 13 h layover. After endless calls, we got Latam to change the route from Buenos Aires to Santiago, with a layover of over 24 h. That reduced our trip one day. The information on the luggage limit was confusing. After at least 5 calls and emails, I got contradictory information and three different amounts to buy an extra suitcase, ranging from US $46 to $180. We couldn’t buy the extra luggage online, only at the airport. So, given the confusing information, we decided not to take any chances. The check-in process in Auckland, Buenos Aires and Santiago was appalling; it took over 20 minutes to sort it out in each case. The worst possible service! In addition, in the long haul Santiago-Sydney they did seat my partner and me together, so when I realised it, I had to return to the counter to get them to change the seats. These were expensive flights, almost US $6000."

We paid extra for the option to have the ability to have our tickets refunded in case we had to cancel. Turns out we had to cancel 1 day after booking the tickets and we immediately submitted the request to refund. They said it will take 30 business days to process the refund (i.e. more than 6 weeks). They have not provided our refunds. We are disputing the transaction with our bank now and Latam is saying they denied the original refund request “due to incorrect information” provided. This is false. Be careful of this airline, they seem to steal people’s money."

I have asked Latam Help desk to change my back to my original booking and give me an explanation why they changed my departure date and time without getting my permission and/or notify me! No explanation was given why they changed the date and they could only refund the ticket. I received email that the refund would be credited to my credit card but the amount Australia dollar!!! Why refund me in Australia dollar when I pay in US dollar!!! I have sent numerous emails with credit card statement that payment in US dollar and not Australia dollar to help desk and even the personal emails of LATAM Top management but no one reply or willing to rectify the mistake.

Omri,"June 8, 2019",Latam,3.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,1,2,1,3,3,No,A warning to those planning on using @LATAMAirlines for their #airtravel. My family and I made this mistake in December 2018 and are still regretting it 6 months later. Our luggage was mishandled and lost en route to #BuenosAires. Almost six months after a claim for delayed baggage compensation  and more than three months after a legally binding settlement letter was received and agreed I have received no compensation. What a #shameful #disgrace of an organisation. In an industry where efficiency and #CustomerService are paramount it is a surprise that @LATAMAirlines has survived. Do yourself a favour and entrust a different carrier with your trip!
Fernando,"May 10, 2019",Latam,3.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I just purchase 4 two-way tickets for my family to visit me on the LATAM website. After I finalized the purchased I realized that the return date was incorrect by a month. So, I immediately call them to rectify the problem. They said I would need to pay $200 dollars por ticket extra to get it fix. I asked why and they say it was due to availability and date changes. Interestingly enough, I already had opened another page on their website with the correct dates and the price of each ticket was actually $100 cheaper!!! So, I told them to just cancel my purchase (which is free on the first 24 hrs), but I couldn’t do that neither, as they said that even though I bought the tickets one of the passenger need to do the cancelling. So, my 75 year-old father will need to call them to cancel this. I can believe they wanted to make $800 dollars to change tickets that were actually cheaper!! I purchased the new tickets and I asked my poor father to call. I will post again what happened with that."
Kelly,"August 16, 2017",Latam,3.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,0,,,0,No,Worst experience ever.  Flight cancelled and personnel completely unhelpful.  I was told the only reason I could not get on earlier flight is because I had not checked in online.  Our group got separated and the others who had checked in went on earlier flight.  They were rushed on to plane so we kept their luggage and were guaranteed we would not be charged for it.  Next day guess what.  Charged for it!!!   Asked to speak to supervisor. Who would not make an exception despite explaining everything. Then I was sent to stand in line in another place to pay the bag fee.   This is the most unhelpful experience i have ever had.  I will never fly LATAM again.  Their attitude  is completely not pro customer and they act like you are a bother.  Add to that the incredible overburden of what seems to be a healthy dose of beaurocracy and you have LATAM. The absolute worse airline customer service I have experienced in Latin America.

Avianca (the airline responsible) had no reason for the ‘bumping’ just that it was full. We had paid for the flight 5 months before in Australia and had confirmed too. So we sit and wait for 4 hrs to be put on the only other flight out of there at approx 12.00pm on a Latam flight. BUT this was only to Cuzco where we had to collect our luggage and run to just get on another airlines flight to Lima. Why the rush? Well we have a connecting flight to Havana Cuba leaving at 4.15pm. We arrived in Lima and the Latam counter 15 minutes before the connecting flight was to leave and guess what – we were a NO SHOW! No amount of talkig or pleading would get us on to that flight!

Michael,"June 4, 2017",Latam,3.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,3,,,3,No,"Call centres are a total joke. Calls are answered by an agent unable to perform any task but request your phone number and assure you someone will call within the hour. It never happens, when you call back and complain they ask for your number again and if you refuse because you now don’t believe them, they hang up. After many calls they managed to arrange a flight home for my wife without her husband and two children , then send us to the Latam shop to pay. So we tried to call Chile from Bogota hoping for better service. This time very nice lady gave us a booking reference for a flight for all four of us and sent us to pay. When we went the flight hadn’t been ticketed and agent couldn’t match the price quoted. Supervisor in Chile is still looking for his staff member to find out what happened. They are a disgrace to deal with. Traveling by ship from Sydney to Colombia would be quicker than getting this mob to rearrange a flight."

As I was trying to check into my flight 2 hours in advance, travelling from St. Vincent to Trinidad–the supervisor at the check in counter, Carveus Trimmingham refused to check me in–stating that the flight was “full”. He did not even look into the computer or my itinerary–he based this decision on asking where I was going and if I had a connecting flight. It was horrible service. I had to fight my way into getting him to check me in. The local people helped as they realized he was quite unfair and he had no grounds to refuse checking me in. They all exclaimed that LIAT do this to passengers often. They overbook and then they look to eliminate. The man, Carveus Trimmingham should not be working with people. He was rude and unkind and I will never use LIAT again. Even his own peers spoke badly of him–one said “you had to deal with him for one day, can you imagine dealing with his attitude for a year?”.

Just had a series of flight around the Caribbean, and every one of them was unpleasant because of LIAT. Customer service seems to be unknown with them, treatment of paying passengers is unreasonable and the general feeling that I got (again) was that I was just an inconvenience to them. So LIAT are consistent at least, bad. I will make even more efforts to avoid them now, life it too short for the hassles and unpleasantness of this airline. Avoid them if you can. Take a ferry, another airline or try and change your route. Holidays are meant to be enjoyed, not endured. Travelling with this airline is far from pleasant. Amazing how they are still in business given the sort of customer ‘service’ that they seem to give as standard."
Lorraine,"April 2, 2018",Liat,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,0,No,"Myself and my fiancé were on our way back from Barbados in December 2017 and we had to get a connecting flight from Barbados international Airport which was to take us to Antigua and then to London. When we checked in for our flight, to our shock that is when we found out that our flight had been changed with no prior notice. So at the last minute we found out that we were no longer going straight to Antigua but we now had to stop over at Guadeloupe first, then to Antigua and then London. We were not notified of these changes to our outbound flight and we found this to be highly unprofessional! The biggest problem was having to stop off at Guadeloupe – in doing so, we lost a lot of time!! Our stop off in Guadeloupe lasted for around 20 minutes and by the time we got to Antigua, we had lost a lot of time and we weren’t able to collect our luggage. Also, when we got to Antigua we were given the wrong information regarding where to go, it seemed like nobody knew what they were doing! So by the time we went to collect our luggage, it turns out our flight had already boarded and the gates were about to close!! Just as we were standing near luggage collection, I could see my hand luggage but the staff did not allow me to collect my case before I boarded the plane so we were forced to go without our luggage. The fact that LIAT gave us an extra stop on our journey caused so many problems and it absolutely ruined our return flight home!! We payed £60 for our seats and we were so distressed about our luggage being left in Antigua that we couldn’t enjoy our flight or even relax. When we got back to London, we had to fill out paperwork and wait for 2 days before we got our luggage back. We found the entire service from LIAT to be a very disappointing experience, their customer service is very poor and they really need to do better! For our first time travelling with LIAT, it was so bad that we both feel like we will NEVER take another LIAT flight again!! The experience was absolutely atrocious!!"

I have flown with them 8-9 times over the past 3 weeks and was delayed only once by about 40 minutes. The trick is to take the early flight. Like at 6:30 or 7am. This way you take the first flight for the day so there can’t be delays. If you take the later flights then you can expect delays and you may miss your connection. Take the earliest flight and you will have no problems

The actual flight was without problem, but while we were waiting to disembark we watched the luggage unloading procedure and were appalled at the way the luggage was handled and saw the way our brand new Samsonite cases were treated, they were taken off a conveyor and thrown on to a metal floored trailer and then it appeared they were being used as targets with other cases being hurled at our cases, they were both scratched to hell and finished up looking decidedly second hand. We would not use Thai Lion air again!!"

They did not check my baggage all the wAy through to my destination and they lost my luggage. On the wAy back to my original destination they would only issue my boarding pass to Bangkok snd not Jakarta even though I am on their airline causing me to have to recheck in Bangkok. In the last three years I have been flying from Jakarta to Chiang Mai with any other airlines , they have always checked me all the way through. Is there s new rule I don’t know about? This is ridiculous and I’ll NEVER fly them again!!!!"

We got a small snack and watter on board. Everything went very smooth. 🙂"
Louis,"March 24, 2016",Lion Air,4.4,Flew Economy,9.0,5,3,5,3,,,3,Yes,Best low cost airline in Thailand. BKK-LOE and BKK-HDY Value for money. Brand new 737-900. Friendly and helpful staff and crew. Planes always on time.( 5 out of 5 times for me ). Nothing to complain about. I believe you get much more than you can expect from a low budget airliner where the crew earns about 15.000THB a month. Will use again this April. And again in August. Nothing to worry about.

The inflight entertaiment was full of movies and shows you can watch easily with your phone. Also the inflight sales had actually very good products for sale.

They canceled my mother return flight and they offered me another flight month and a half after the flight they’ve canceled and a refund for the flight, but only one way, so it means they offered me to pay me back less than half the price that I paid for two ways. Everyone knows that the price of one ticket is almost the same with the price of two way. The only thing that I can do now is to leave 1star reviews on every site possible and never flight with LOT again, neither me or anyone that I know"

But the ticket for the next day costed me 380. In the following days I tried to phone the customer service again where they always referred me back to the ticket provider and they referred me to LOT. At the end they told me they could give 1 but I need to innitiate it by paying 12 which is the worst insolence I ever been put through. Not to speak about how they responded to my friendly request for help which was 2 pages long, they responded 1 minute directly after I send it in which they basically said they are sorry"

Then they said I had to have a Visa to be in Poland to order to get my next flight to Germany (which is not either required for USA citizens)! Then they said that for Covid restrictions I can’t fly to Germany (I had valid negative Covid test on me but they refused to look at it) other than the inappropriate questions about my visits to Europe and the racist ways to talk and asking questions! I ended up losing my flight to Germany, my 2nd flight to USA and my 3rd flight to home city in USA!

The site indicated that for adults with children there is priority when registering and boarding a plane, special food for children and “entertainment – audio, video, games.”  None of the above has been completed.  I stood in the general queue for registration, on the plane we were given FOR TWO, ME AND CHILD one chocolate waffle, a roll with an apple and a glass of water!!! The whole trip took us about 5 hours including delayed! All two flights my child cried a lot, because  was hungry. If I knew that there would be NO SPECIAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN, I would take food, water, a cartoon tablet and money! On board the plane, the flight attendants hit my sleeping child’s legs with this metal box of food many times, and never apologized. They only cared about the people who bought food. I had no where to remove legs, because space is so small. I don’t recommend flying with this company, especially with a child! Just awful!!!"

We unexpectedly couldn’t make our 6/25 ORD to WAW flight and called LOT’s customer service before the flight left to rebook. After waiting on hold for at least 40 minutes, our 6/25 flight departed and LOT automatically cancelled our flights. LOT’s customer service said they could not rebook our flights but the LOT ORD ticket counter could help us the next day. On 6/26, we met with the ORD supervisor, initials BB. BB said he could rebook us on the 5:30 pm flight that day for an extra charge of $2500 for 5. We waited at least an hour before BB said the 5:30 pm flights weren’t available now but he could book us on the 9:30 pm flights for the same extra charge. We waited another 1-2 hours before BB said the 9:30 pm flights were only available to us at full fares of $7300. In total we waited FIVE hours to make new reservations. We are very disappointed and angry at LOT and BB for our $4800 in extra cost and time, and LOT’s ineffective and inflexible processes and poor handling of a common airline situation."

They offered for additional substantial money to upgrade to 1st class (!!).  LOT’s  behavior was rude, abusive appalling .  All passengers around my seat got quite upset by LOT’s behavior.

Be aware that according to the airline’s response of their rules, you should basically not put anything in your checked-in luggage.

They can pick you among other passengers and interrogate you on your destination and where you  traveled from and why you have been there. I was visiting my uncle in Italy and it was urgent and i had no choice but to book lufthansa . On my way back from Italy to Sweden i stopped by Germany. an officer picked all non whites going out of the aircraft and checked my Swedish passport that it was not fake. and asked me why i am going to Sweden, even thought the passport is Swedish!! i said i am going home!!! Then he asked me what i was doing in Italy. EU schengen laws does not apply in Germany. I have all the right to travel with my ID card and i dont even need a passport but in Germany they  do not respect this and they are not that advanced to understand that racial profiling is racism. They think it is normal. So, if you are not white do not take lufthansa ever."

I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline’s customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. . Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat, they changed their minds three (3) times, stating that the compensation was only offered to European travelers, not Americans."

They had a connecting flight with Turkish Airlines and the layover between connecting flights was 90 mints. Flights left from Perth with a delay of 30 minutes and they just issued one boarding pass and told them that they will get other boarding pass from Turkish Airline help desk on KL  Airport Malaysia, so technically they have 60 minutes left to change the flight. When they landed on KL Malaysia and went to Turkish Airline help desk they said they didn’t receive any information from Malaysian Airlines. Just imagine the level of professionalism of Malaysian Airlines. When they went to Malaysian Airlines help desk they had closed their help desk and eventually my parents who are diabetic patients missed their flight. It was almost midnight and no one was there to help them. This incident was happened with 11 passengers from the same flight. I will never ever recommend Malaysian Airlines to anyone in my life.

Prakash,"December 5, 2019",Malaysia Airlines,4.4,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,2,1,1,,1,No,"The worst flight experience of my life. The aircraft looked old and uncleaned. The food was cheap and insipid in a small snack size pack with no accompaniments. The worst part is they did not give dinner when we landed in the night. The entertainment was just in the name ( again they got the cheap old TV series and movies) on styled consoles. Since the twin tragedies, I have been avoiding this airline. But due to emergency I had to book the same day. This was the only airline that had seat availability for my route. I thought they may like to attract people with good service, food and entertainment. How wrong I was. Just an example: When I asked the cabin crew if she has any snacks for dinner, even peanuts will do. She rudely said we have none. They used a $2 coke bottle to serve it in cheap plastic glass to the entire zone. Last but not the least, they lost my baggage. DO NOT EVER TRAVEL with Malaysia Airlines."

My membership is classified as Silver and as Ruby. According to the OneWorld website, this equals to Ruby status. Furthermore, the OneWorld website qualifies the privileges as per the following Link. When I tried to book my seats, the system requested that I pay $100s for my seat pre-allocation which should not happen for a Silver/Ruby Status. I called your call centre and was told to write an email. Please let me know what the problem is? Are you a OneWorld carrier or NOT? I selected to fly MH only because of the OneWorld membership. Here is the response from Malaysian Airlines: “Please be advised that access to preferred or pre-reserved seating is in accordance with MH’s policy NOT the oneworld. X go to MH and Qantas side. Please refer actical 29 for more details. Based on above if you required the seat in advance it will be a charges base on the airlines term and condition. X contact our call center to booking and purchase the requested seat. Thank you for choosing Malaysia Airlines. Warm Regards, Muhammad Nabil | Global Customer Contact Centre"
Nils,"February 7, 2019",Malaysia Airlines,4.4,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,3,1,,,1,No,"Flight MHO0796 on Feb 5th, KUL-BKK, Business class. Ground staff that had poor English skills. Long and very bad security clearance procedure at the gate! No priority for Business class. Finding a cabin that is from the 80s, at its best. Old seats and the springs or whatever it is inside the chair, had popped making the seat very uncomfortable. Seat belt had been shortened ,why?, so an extension was needed to be able to lock the seat belt. No inflight entertainment system, no wine or alcohol served “as this flight is to short for that”, 2 hours 30 minutes too short? The poor stewardess did her best but said she was a shame of the poor cabin standard. Several of the passengers come together after the flight waiting for the luggage, and all had the same opinion, never again MAS! Malaysia Airlines, To be fair to your passengers reimburse with at least 50% of the ticket price cause this is no where close to Business class!"
Raymond,"January 30, 2019",Malaysia Airlines,4.4,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,4,5,3,,,5,Yes,"After reading so many negative comments about Malaysian Airline, I ought to say something from a different perspective. I have taken two flights (a total of 6 sectors) with Malaysian Airline in the last 4 months originating Hong Kong. The flights never have disappointed me, despite using 737-800 for a 4-hour flight is not so ideal. However, on their A330 and A380, things are completely different, there’s literally nothing I can complain about. The food itself is unbeatable (except for the sectors departing HKG, thanks to CPCS for handling the nasty food), the Malay Satay is one of the best food I have ever had on a plane, there are also plenty of other choices. Hot food is served even on a 25-minute flight from SIN to KUL. Service was also nothing to complain. I fell asleep right after the plane departed and the crew members have taken my orders. No one woke me up but instead quietly came to my side and closed the window shield for me. I was asked whether I was in the mood for food 10 seconds after I was awake. Staffs were attentive and they cared for every detail. Check-ins were efficient and baggage handling was also to a very acceptable manner. The lounge in KUL is also a plus for choosing MH. Great food served in a quiet environment where one can also spot planes taking off and landing with ease. If I have to choose between KA and MH for the same route again, I will definitely choose MH as their price is just a no beater when compared to KA or CX."
Al,"September 29, 2018",Malaysia Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,1,,,1,No,"Would NEVER fly again Flight departing Phuket with 2hr layover and connection to Bali. Bali flight changed from 3pm to 9am the next day. Absolutely unacceptable. a 2hr layover changed to an 18hr layover! Flight from Phuket has mechanical problems. Fair enough, atleast this pilot spotted it before takeoff, we don’t want to end up like MH370. Staff actually relatively good at getting us all on a bus and to a hotel within 5 hours. Told our flight is now rescheduled to 9pm, bus leaving at 7pm from hotel. I have a screaming baby who has been ‘travelling’ for 12hrs already and we haven’t got 20 miles from our origin. I call the representative to ask to change flights to the next day or day after. She asks me to call BKK call center. I call them, The woman says she will change the flight for me, however does not. She says I must collect my ba from the airport and then puts me on hold indefinately. I my own way to the airport to collect my own bag with the help of Thai airline staff, as there are NO Malaysia airline staff anywhere to be found. I call again the next day after we had ‘missed our flights’ and the woman thankfully re-booked us for two days time."
Fred,"July 30, 2018",Malaysia Airlines,4.4,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,5,3,,,3,No,"I bought a return business class with MAS last year for trip with my family to Sydney Australia. The problems started with our inability to utilise the on-demand dining service due to an error on their website which we were told was due to a system upgrade. As regular fliers we chalked this down to one of those things that every company goes through and didn’t think more if it. On my return flight, I again went to check in online and use the service but again online check-in and dine on demand was unavailable. Again thought nothing of it until I arrived at Sydney airport. Not only did I arrive to a closed check-in counter with no ground staff available. I was told (eventually by Sydney airport staff) that the flight time had been changed and clearly I had not been notified despite MAS having my mobile and email address. Attempts to contact MAS customer service were useless and I eventually had to purchase a 1 way ticket on the day with QR in order to get back home on time. I raised a complaint via MAS customer centre only to be kept on hold for long periods of time and I was repeatedly told that I may not have been informed of the flight change time due to what became the infamous “system upgrade” and the excessive wait times were due to my record not being found due to the “system upgrade”. I have made repeated attempts to contact MAS customer service and management team for over a year to no avail. The most I have received is a luke warm “we are looking into it message” from a customer service agent. I have nothing but utter disdain and shock at how MAS has behaved on this matter. Customer Service is Poor to say the least. The airline has gone from being one of the premium airlines to an utter shambles both in aircraft quality, service and reliability. For the money their premium tickets cost, there is far much better value for money from other airlines."
nia,"July 15, 2018",Malaysia Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,3,,,3,No,"The flight from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur was a new flight MH4. It was hard to call for the steward/stewardess as the button was too far. I’m in an economy and the seat worked as well as the entertainment. The meal was delicious but the portion had become smaller compared to what I received last year on my flight from Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow. The landing and take off was quite harsh and shocking. The temperature, messages from the captain and luggage were fine. However, the BIG ISSUE is the service from the flight attendant. They acted snob and bias. They were harsh with the Malaysian and extremely noisy when it came to delivering foods. WE WERE NOT IN NIGHT MARKET! I’m a Malaysian myself and I repeated to take Malaysia Airlines because I received the best service from the flight attendant before. The steward and stewardess treated the foreigner nicely but served the local Malaysian with words like NAK APA! (What do you want!) instead of YA, NAK APA CIK (Yes, can I help you, miss). I saw them gave the pencil box souvenir to the English kids but not to the Malaysian kids. Whats wrong with you guys! The Malaysian kids even asked their mom nicely why didn’t they get the pencil box? The mom smiled. If I remember the stewardess and steward names, I will definitely mention them here and report to Malaysia Airlines myself. I will btw. This will be my last time with MAS and the snobbish flight attendant irritated me and my family. They even made noise and chatted about who slept and what not. They even mentioned that the English kids slept cutely in flight and they were awed. What the hell???? We want tranquillity and calm journey. Not your chatty business!"

Upon check-in at Perth we were assured that this would be taken care of on all legs of the flight, Perth to KL and KL to Kochi.  On arrival at Kochi, at 2340 hours in the night, he was left unattended.  There was nobody on the aircraft to provide any information to him.  Having gotten tired of waiting he left the aircraft and found his way to the carousel, claimed his baggage, passed through immigration, customs and exited the airport to be received by the person waiting for him.  This entire process was a strain for him, this being the first time he’s travelling alone.  The airline has failed in its duty of care for a minor.  The stress caused on the young person travelling is a completely different story. Customer service stand was that unless you email customer care about your issues, we cannot resolve or do anything about this. Please do not fly this airline at all.  Non existent services and unhelpful and unprofessional staff."
bhavika,"April 11, 2019",Malindo Air,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"I am a travel agent and I had booked my clients flight through Malindo. Apparently they have started this new rule as to no luggage and meal in economy class, which was fine. but their own manage booking site was showing that in return journey meals and baggage is inluded despite their technical glitch, which they accepted and yet this was their response “we cant help it”. Also after mailing them 3-4 times and calling them ennumber of time for 3 consecutive days. still no revert or acceptance from their end. and finally our departure date coming nearer my client had to buy luggage and meals. and as it was showing on their manage booking page through the whole trip our client blamed us that we are charging extra from them. So, To Travel Agents please donot book this airline they are not at all supportive infact you will regret. To clients if something like this happen, trust me we are there to help you, We can understand the hassle you are going through. and the funny part Malindo airlines is an International airline (HAHAHAHA)"

Nicholas,"November 7, 2018",Malindo Air,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,4,2,4,,,3,No,"Malindo air – The worst airline ever 1. Flight got rescheduled to following day We booked a straight flight to kota kinabalu for 3 November 2018. However, to our dismay, the flight was cancelled and our flight got rescheduled to 4 November 2018, just 2 weeks prior to departure. We tried calling the agent and airline several times and our flight was rescheduled on 3 November 2018. The whole process of the rescheduling took all the remaining 2 weeks and the customer service took very long to reply to our email. We had to take the initiative to follow-up on the issue. This is unacceptable and they only confirmed our flight 3 days before our flight. The airline also refused to make any kind of refund. 2. One passenger ticket got void when we check-in When we checked in on the day of our flight, we were informed that one of our friend’s flight was voided due to system error. As a result of it, that friend of mine had to purchase another ticket to kota kinabalu. Malindo airline told us that it was the agent’s issue and when we called the agent, the agent told us that it was malindo airline who cancelled our flight. Ultimately, we, the consumers are the ones who are suffering the consequences from all the errors. 3. Denied assess to board on 2nd flight As it was a transit flight, we received 2 boarding pass upon check-in. 1. SIN – KUL: 12.20pm – 1.25pm 2. KUL – KK: 2.30pm – 5.10pm At the check in counter, we were informed that the flight has been delayed to 1.15pm and we asked the customer service officer if we will be able to catch the transit flight as the time frame was only about an hour. The customer service officer told us that we should be able to catch the flight as the KUL – KK flight got delayed too. if we were to miss our transit flight, we will be able to board the next flight available to Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur Airport. Our new flight timings were as follow: 1. SIN – KUL: 1.15pm – 2.20pm 2. KUL – KK: 3.15pm – 6.25pm We arrived at Kuala Lumpur Airport at about 2.30pm and we were 30 minutes away from our next flight. We rushed to the transfer gate and the gate to our next flight was not opened. We made it in time. However, to our utter disappointment, we were denied access to the flight as the staff told us that our flight has been rescheduled to a later flight timing (6.45pm). 4. We were not informed on the change to a later flight We spoke to the duty manager and we were told that they rescheduled our flight to a later timing as the transfer of the luggage takes 40 minutes and our sin-kul was delayed. Hence, they shifted our flight to a later flight without informing us. We only found out when our boarding pass was rejected just before boarding the plane. The point being, we booked 6 tickets with free check-in luggage but we had only 2 check-in luggage. When we first checked in in Singapore they should have given us a choice whether we want to check in our luggage as it may delay our transit flight. We asked if we will be able to make it for our transit flight and we were reassured that it was possible to catch the flight. Clearly, it was not. Furthermore, we were asked to wait another 2 hours before we were issued the new boarding pass for an even later 6.45pm flight. Our new seats were not even guaranteed 1 hour before this flight. Another 2 groups on the same flights as we were faced similar issues: unresponsive customer care service, last minute flight changes, uninformed changes to flight etc. 5. Malindo airline is the first airline that is able to screw up 4 times for a flight from Singapore to Malaysia, we reached Singapore airport at 10.30am and arrived KK’s airport at 10.30pm Malindo airline has disappointed us again and again. Because of the mistakes, we wasted our time and spent our whole day traveling from Singapore to Malaysia! This is definitely unacceptable. We are utterly disappointed by the service given and this whole issue is ridiculous. We strongly advised everyone not to take malindo airline."
Lynne,"June 24, 2018",Malindo Air,3.4,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"Congratulations Malindo Air for the superb service you offer from checking in to arriving at your destination. I flew with Malindo Air for the first time – Denpasar Kuala Lumpur Return 22.06.18. This was my first time flying with the airline on a low budget priced ticket. Compared with the other airlines flying out of Australia that I normally use, Malindo Airlines offers so much more. The cost of my ticket was AUD 250 return compared to other airlines charging much more. Roomy leg room is not just offered on 1st class or business class or an addition you have to pay for on an upgrade, but for all seating. The seats were wide and comfortable with entertainment screen system for watching movies music etc. This was included in your ticket. Meals were provided which were fresh tasty and nutritious. Again included in the cost of the ticket. Air hostesses were excellent well organised & friendly. 25kg of luggage was included in the ticket price. I am a frequent traveler living in Indonesia, continually fly in fly out. In future Malindo Air will definitely by my first preference of airline."
KISHOR,"May 25, 2018",Malindo Air,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,"Very poor amenities. Highly unprofessional staff. You won’t be given water for at least 1.5 hours after take off, no matter how many times you request- so carry your own water bottle. Food served is pathetic- so carry your own food. Blanket is not given until food is served- so carry your own blanket. On asking for blanket for 5th time, the air hostess shouted at me – “You want blanket first or you want food first?”. When I said I’m thirsty and need water, the air hostess told rudely, “you will have to wait until food is served”. There’s no TV screen – so carry your laptop for entertaining yourselves to deviate your mind away from the pathetic service. Lights are almost always on and they won’t give you eye-cap or pillow – so carry your own stuff. The staff won’t attend to you until you use the call button at least twice or thrice.The attendants manually spray air freshener and they don’t take care to see that it is not sprayed on passenger’s face. Kindly don’t humiliate yourself by travelling in this airline."
John,"August 16, 2017",Malindo Air,3.4,Flew Economy,5.0,3,3,4,3,,,4,No,"Look they’ve got potential but out of 3 flights, only one left on time and the other three had a total of 8 hours of delays. Yes, 8 hours. 5 hours for one out of KUL. And the delays were pure incompetence – no chocks for the wheels, no pilots and poor ground handling of turn-around. 90 minutes to turn around a 737.  As for the rest, 3 flights had great IFE, the last one simply had blank seat-backs – no warning, not cheaper… weak. The cabin crew were fine, I liked the food and the flights progressed as you’d hope when they actually got going. They’re now flying out of my city – BNE – but they’re trying to charge full price for a service you can not rely upon. At the proper price, based on their actual costs, and with a reliable service they could be worth it.  Like I said, they’ve got potential, but the reality has some way to go."
meera kanakamma,"August 16, 2017",Malindo Air,3.4,Flew Economy,2.0,3,4,1,4,,,3,No,I am satisfied with malindo’s in flight services.  But malindo has very bad luggage services.  I missed my luggage during inbound and outbound journey from Kualumpur airport.  I got my inbound luggage after 3 days and outbound after 2 days.  Some serious organizational issues in their baggage section. May be the staffs are either non- professional or irresponsible.  An airline can easily spoil your wonderful vaccation.  That is the conclusion. I will not recommend malindo any more evenif I travelled 2-3 times before my last spoiled trip. If malindo needs to keep their reputation they have to work on the issue rather than trying to find out the missing luggage and give it back to the passenger after 2 or 3 days..  Really unprofessional and irresponsible!!!

On July first I was to travel with my family to KUL for a short holiday and business work, departure was at 12:15 midday. Flight was continuously delayed, reason given was due technical problems when I called the sales office in Hanoi. The Customer care number for Malindo in KUL is a joke as nobody ever answered, just keeps you on hold and ended me with a staggering phone bill, same experience with all other passengers on the flight. Once arrived to the airport, nobody was there to update us, counter staff just said flight is leaving now and lied, also lied saying station manager will come but she never came. Eventually by 10 pm AT NIGHT all passengers were furious and demanded to see the manager as we had children and elderly…..finally the manager came and said she doesn’t have much information and sorry! What kind of a joke was that, is this even a proper company with educated staff. Just 3 hours before dep only business class lounge was given. No responsibility was taken as they said so…by Malindo for the Money we lost in hotel bookings and other passeng"

Rhys,"February 19, 2013",Maswings,6.3,Flew Economy,7.0,0,3,3,0,,,3,Yes,"I travel regularly through Malaysia and on this occasion I was travelling in East Malaysia on the island of Borneo.  The flight was MH3807 from Bintulu to Kuching. MASwings is the propeller fleet of Malaysian Airlines and services the smaller regional cities of Malaysia.  Being part of Malaysian Airlines the booking and web checkin facilities are the same which is convenient. I don’t fly propeller planes often but actually enjoy them for several reasons.  First of all you get to walk across the tarmac.  I enjoy doing this as it reminds me of the old days when airports didn’t have air-bridges.  It’s kind of nice to get out onto the tarmac and walk to the plane.  Almost like a scene out of Casablanca.  As I’m walking I’m sizing it up, checking out how old or dodgy it looks and whether I’ve made the right decision.  I’m happy to visualise a scene out of Casablanca but if the weather is looking ominous or the plane old and rickety then it can sometimes remind me of the final flight of Buddy Holly and Richie Valens. Luckily on this occasion the weather was fine and the plane looked new.  This MASwings plane was an ATR 72-500.  A nice looking plane with two large propellers.  It has an aisle down the middle and holds 68 passengers.  I had a very pleasant flight.  I like this sort of travel where the distances are short and you feel like you are really flying with the buzzing of the propellers and being lower to the ground you can actually see a lot better out the windows.  The planes are comfortable for short flights but certainly don’t have the comforts of the bigger planes. Basic seats, no entertainment and no meals other than some peanuts and a drink.  Still it’s nice arriving at the other end and walking down the stairs , crossing the tarmac and straight into the baggage area. Thanks MASwings. You got me there safely and on time and Buddy Holly and Richie Valens were not waiting for me on the other side."

I personally enjoyed a can of beer (yes the can! not a small cup filled halfway). the entertainment  was fair enough. I enjoyed watching one of my favorite series (friends). not to mention the flight attendants: they were very nice with a very special warm smile. although I was flying Economy, I was shocked by how enjoyable this flight was and wished it lasted a little bit longer!"

When we landed and i came to pickup the luggage the suitcase was seriously  damaged, as if somebody destroyed it on purpose. After complaining about this at the counter from montenegro airlines they were very rude and explained to me that it was not their responsibility if baggae was damaged or even lost. Btw the plane was very old and the stuff quit unfrieldy – what a shabby airline, even Ryan Air und Wizz Air are taking responsibility for handling the luggage and offer a much better service!

Koen,"March 23, 2023",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,Yes,"I don’t understand the negatieve reviews by passengers, my experiences with NOK are exceeding what is expected from a LCC, they provide basic service on basic tarif, provide additional services based on tickets purchased, it doesn’t cost much to have an upgrade, allowing pre-seat options, snacks or meal included in a flight or early access to the plane.. ofcourse there is no entertainment in the plane, but that goes for any LCC and a lot of regional carriers… this should not even be put for rating.. Their staff has been friendly and professional on any flight I took with them, my overall experience with them is better than any LCC in Europe, Asia, South and North America."
Thomas,"October 7, 2022",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,6.0,4,3,2,0,1,2,2,No,"The cheerful canary yellow uniforms of the flight crew are matched by the livery of their aircraft – If only the happiness went into their attitude as well. Yes, they are a low-cost carrier, and I am sure the crew doesn’t have the same work environment as the crews of higher-end airlines – but that is no justification for a bad attitude. Everything about the flight was – low cost. They have so much potential. At least they had a Skybridge at DMK and HKT."
Jett,"March 4, 2020",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,,1,0,No,"Leaving this review as a parting note to this airline. Nok Air is hands down the worst airline in Thailand. First off, it has the worst safety rating among all its peers, with a 2 out of 7 star rating on airlineratings.com. Secondly and why I hate it: it has the highest rate of delays I have ever experienced. The last flight I took with Nok Air was booked FOR me without me knowing it was them. Once I realized this, I quickly called the airline asking them to CALL me, NOT TEXT me, if there would be a delay because I need adjust my plans accordingly. Lo and behold! The day of the flight they TEXTED me that the flight would be delayed. Note I asked them to call me but they texted me instead. Anyway, I called and demanded that they put me on an earlier flight to make up for this delay. They conceded and put me on an earlier flight…WHICH ALSO DELAYED! Absolutely comical."

Nina,"June 26, 2017",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,3,1,,,1,No,"I was a huge fan of Nok Air a few years back, when they served proper meals and didn’t try to rip off their clients with “flight promotions”, and gave 20kgs. I decided to fly Nok Air because I saw that the price was a little lower than Bangkok air, then I thought to myself “ok why not this time”. Only to find out upon checking in for the flight that my ticket was on a so-called “cheap promotion” and it was in extremely fine print that each passenger has only an allowance of 5kgs on the plane. The service lady on the counter was extremely rude and stated that “yeah but it was on super fine print”. However, this isn’t correct, when it is a 5kg allowance, it SHOULD be stated LOUD AND CLEAR that if they don’t buy extra kilos online, they will have to pay $10 per kilo upon check-in!!! Clearly cheating the clients! Usually, they allow 20kgs per passenger with “‘membership”, so you can imagine how many kilos we brought. 20 kgs each, 15 kgs overweight baggage charge (15*$10=$150 per person) … this flight ended up being more expensive than Bangkok Airways who provide top quality service, food, and kilograms as opposed to this scam."
Luiz,"March 1, 2017",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"On 06 / Dec / 2016 I purchased 4 Nok Air tickets to travel on Feb 16, 2017, from Koh Phi Phi to Bangkok via Phuket (tickets included boat, bus and plane). Two weeks before the trip, I received an email from Nok Air stating that the flight was canceled and that no other options were available. On the basis of this information, I bought another ticket, via Krabi, by Air Asia and asked for the refund of the amount paid, pleading for the coverage of the additional expenses I would have, for buying a ticket on time, plus boat and transfer. Initially Nok Air informed me that it would cover all my costs, but shortly afterwards she said she would only refund the amount paid. I had no assistance from Nok Air. I had to buy another more expensive ticket at another company, look for a boat option and make the transfer on my own. Worst of all is that Nok Air had the same option, via Krabi, which I bought at Air Asia, but it hid me from this fact. And to complete, more than 30 days have passed since the flight was canceled and the amount paid was not returned. And I do not think it will be."

Even though the flight was only one hour we were served with a snack and a drink. On the return journey we flew from Ubon Ratchathani on a A320. Again a snck was served. The Ground staff and flight attendants were friendly and helpful.

John,"January 14, 2015",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy,9.0,5,4,4,0,,,2,Yes,"I fly NOK Air often in Thailand and to Myanmar (8-10 times per year, at least).  Last flight taken was Bangkok-Phitsanuloke (return). They have upgraded the 737’s on the legs I normally fly on to a new larger model, 737-800.  Seats are a bit tight for non-Thai’s, but most flights are about an hour, so no problem.  Overheads are huge on new planes.  If you travel with additional baggage, weight, golf clubs, etc., buy the additional weight over 15 Kg when you book online, it is a lot cheaper.  Their reservation system does not consistently work with Firefox, but has no problem with IE. Flights have been on time in my experience."
Kilian,"July 19, 2013",Nok Air,5.7,Flew Economy,7.0,4,3,4,0,,,3,Yes,cool little airline. all aircraft have their own little personal differences in the livery. crew is young and very friendly. yes the planes are old but the cabin isn’t too bad at all. good value for your money. you receive a small snack and 15kg checked baggage with every fare!

Jonathan,"August 18, 2023",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,0,3,1,1,4,1,1,No,"The plane itself (787) was great, but the rest was disappointing.  While the flight over had some redeeming qualities, the flight back -rather the whole process- was a nightmare.  Everyone is angry.  My seven-year-old daughter even commented that we should have flown Delta.  We arrived nearly four hours early and waited in line for about three of those hours.  The check-in process was a complete disaster.  It was disorganized and completely unfair.  We waited as gate agents allowed-even directed others to break in front of us.  Yes, we realize there were three flights the gate crew was dealing with (NY, FLA, and DC), yet we should not be punished for the lateness of others.  For every two Florida flights checked-in, they should have moved a DC guest through.  Instead, they held all DC passengers until all New York and then Florida passengers were done -even those arriving mins before boarding.  That is poor managements and all on Norse.  There was not one single person in the DC line happy with this experience -I expect them to get more complaints."
Chris,"August 7, 2023",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"At airport awaiting my third Norwegian flight in 10 days. First one delayed by one hour fifty minutes, second one by one hour and just been notified that next flight delayed by 50 minutes. Which will probably mean that we miss our connecting flight. For each of the flights the boarding gates have been changed. The first time this happened we were actually queuing to board. Overall, a very frustrating experience and very poor customer service. Think long and hard before you book with this airline."
Fabian,"June 13, 2023",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,3,2,1,No,"The customer service at Norwegian Airlines is terrible. I was overcharged for an in-flight purchase. They do not offer any customer service over the phone, so I was asked to fill out a contact form. Which I did. It took four weeks to get a reply (despite repeated follow-ups), which basically stated: tough luck, we won’t help you."
Maxime,"December 30, 2021",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,3,3,0,1,3,0,No,"Part of my checked luggage was stolen (probably by an airport employee) during my flight from Tromso to Oslo. Norwegian Airlines just flat refused to refund me, saying that my checked luggage wasn’t packed as advised on their website, which is wrong : I did follow their guidelines, so their excuse to not refund me is just plain bullshit so they, a multimillion dollar company, can save some euros at the expense of one of their clients. In the future I’ll choose SAS or another company to travel across Scandinavia as I don’t want to lose an extra 200 euros when I’m traveling."
Kurtis,"August 2, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"All I can comment on is the booking and cancellation process.  PLEASE BEWARE OF THEIR POLICIES AS THEY AND DESIGNED TO KEEP YOUR MONEY.  I booked  two sets of tickets; one leaving the US in June and the second coming back from Paris in Sept.  Due to my travel plans through Europe, they could not be booked on same itinerary.  Norwegian cancelled my first flight without notifying me of said cancellation until the week before the travel date.   Once I saw the cancellation, I looked at my return ticket and all flights out of Paris to Denver had been deleted from their schedule all the way into 2021. — they told me that since they had not given my notice of cancellation (even though on their website 100% of the flights had been cancelled), that i did not follow the fare rules of the low fare.     Sketchy policy and I will definitely not allow any of my employees or friends travel this airline."
Rebecca,"April 30, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Norwegian airlines website is as clear as mud, and, I believe, purposefully so. I spent over an hour trying to get an answer to my question about canceling my ticket in June with no avail. Given the current pandemic, you’d think this policy and procedure would be on full display, as it is on American Airlines (I merely had to follow prompts and click a button to cancel that flight). I finally found some partial information that I thought I understood. It stated I can cancel and make a claim for points or reimbursement, or at least that was my understanding. Turns out when I canceled it, I lost everything because it didn’t qualify and they had not canceled the flight. I called to see if I had any recourse and they were rude and non-helpful. If their website was clear, this would not have happened. If their policy was fair, this would not have happened. I will never fly Norwegian again and I suggest if you want to be assured of a fair deal if something goes wrong, that you don’t either."

Joe,"March 23, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,4,1,0,4,4,4,No,"NORWEGIAN AIR SHUTTL OSL/OAK Flight 7063 on 10/15/2019. The flight was booked for a price of $803.51 round trip total for myself and my companion. For each leg, we were provided an opportunity to “Bid for an upgrade.” For each leg, I intended to bid 10% additional (about $40 in each case). I found the process confusing, but did my best. I was shocked to open my credit card statement and find that I was billed a total of $1834.50 for the trip, which is a 128% increase in the fare as opposed to my intended 10% increase. I contacted Norwegian Air and was refused any adjustment even when I offered to settle for what the average person pays for the upgrade. In the end, this confusing upgrade process and refusal to provide a reasonable settlement appears to be a corporate strategy to enhance the bottom line with no regard for customer satisfaction."
PAolo,"March 10, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I will never book with Norwegian again! I booked a flight and after a few days I received a no-reply email informing me they they would have used DAT airline.  Now just check on youtube what DAT is all about. It is scary.  They fly with 30 years old aircrafts.  But the nightmare was to contact them. It was impossible. After many tries via phone, chat and email I received an answer….I could not be refunded. I will have to buy another ticket  with another airline in order to not panic.  What a terrible experience"
Zachary,"March 6, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"Absolutely horrible customer service. My wife has an immunodeficiency disease and cannot travel given the current COVID-19 situation (her doctor strongly discouraged her from flying out of JFK, not to mention flying to Europe). In spite of this, Norwegian is unwilling to offer any sort of refund, travel voucher, or change fee waiver (their change fees are $600, almost the cost of the tickets). They are too greedy to deserve anyone’s business, and I certainly won’t be flying with them again."
Dean,"March 6, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,3,,2,1,No,"Was a good airline, but things seem to be going downhill…  Customer service is effectively non-existant – contracted out to some couldn’t-care-less outfit somewhere in the less developed world.  Didn’t used to be like this.  You need to be aware that if anything changes with your booking, or there is a problem with the flight then you’ll be left “up the creek without a paddle” – there will be no, repeat no assistance from Norwegian or their staff.  Refunds of compensation – forget it.  Policy is to ignore you for several months before possibly and very reluctantly doing the very least they can get away with.  Be aware of this before you book – there’s a reason the fares are cheap…  You get what you pay for."
Danielle,"January 30, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"HORRIBLE. Norwegian changed the time of my flight so it lands at 11:10PM which makes it too late to check in to my hotel. I call them immediately, they check for other flights, can’t find any so basically tell me there is nothing they can do unless I want to cancel the trip. It’s despicable. THEY changed the flight and now I have to eat the 150 euro I paid for the hotel and sleep in the airport or pay for another hotel with a late check-in. They won’t even put me up for the night because the delay doesn’t make it a new day. How scummy is that. I also flew with them last October, they give no food even for long overnight flights without an additional fee. My headrest was broken and they did nothing to fix it so I was uncomfortable for 8 hours. I should have known better than to book with them again. Whatever you do DO NOT FLY NORWEGIAN."
Sheila,"January 11, 2020",Norwegian,3.3,Flew Premium Economy Class,8.0,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,Yes,"I think your data re Norwegian is out of date, Airline Ratings. We’ve had two long-haul Premium Economy flights with hold bags, food, alcohol, blankets, etc included. We flew Miami to London on NYE and the flight was fine. Our “hostess” was sweet – young and bubbly, on her last flight before leave. We were served sparkling wine then dinner, in a bit of a rush so we could celebrate the New Year at London time. We honestly don’t remember the meal, which means it was mostly acceptable and there was plenty of alcohol 🙂 . I do remember Heineken being the only beer offered but a far better Norwegian one materialised – thanks! They were trialling a new breakfast. I hope they scrap the vile cardboard sandwich and the vanilla (not natural) yoghurt with optional additions. No complaints other than that."

The peak of impudence: when checking in online for the return flights, we were offered “premium seats” for the two flights: we spent 100€ because extra leg room and space was suggested. We did this because the outbound flight was quite modest in terms of comfort. Big surprise and frustration when boarding: the “premium seats” are stinking normal economy seats and there were no benefits for the money paid. This is a deliberate deception or fraud of the airline on the customer! I have criticized this in writing and demanded my money back.

Nor was there any effort by the crew to check for loose objects. I spoke to the Captain and he checked that the seatbelt indicators were working. But there was no apparent procedure for reporting this mistake by the flight crew. Tolerating small mistakes leads to bigger mistakes… Good service overall, though the ground service is struggling to keep up. In lots of small ways. Hopefully they will improve their discipline on safety which should be the number 1 priority."
Joseph,"August 29, 2019",Oman Air,4.0,Flew Business Class,7.0,4,4,1,3,,3,4,Yes,"I had four long distance business class flights with Oman Air. First 2 flights were good, but last 2 flights with some problems. I asked for sleepers, but only after fourth or fifth request I could get them.I didn’t understand why, but It happened on both flights. I made online check in, but they changed my seat during boarding, There were no passengers other then me, but I had to wait for bording long time.  I understand that it happens sometimes, but my seat which I have chosen was free. I thouhgt I could sit in that seat after take off, but Oman air stewardess who was there as passenger took the seat before take off.  Maybe not big problems, and not that important, but they occured consecutevly so made my flights a little unpleasant."

The flight attendants did a spectacular job of being attentive to our needs. You could tell the plane is older, but it was still a comfortable ride. We were served two hot meals. I was even able to get an extra blanket from one of the flight attendants since the ones provided are a bit narrow for my larger stature. They had a large selection of Wine, Liquor, and Beer on board as well as drinks. The inflight entertainment was a bit limited with older movies. I asked one of the flight attendants why and he said the holder of most of their contracts requires the entertainment but doesn’t reimburse them for a higher quality. I had movies ready on my iPad but I did watch two of theirs. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and wish I was able to book a flight with them all the time."

BOTH times my husband and I arrived at the airport only to find out that our flight had been cancelled several weeks before and we were NEVER informed. We confirmed with the airline that they had our correct contact information and they claim that they sent an SMS or email but we searched all of our records and there was NOTHING. We have been able to get a last minute flight with a different airline, but it has cost us a FORTUNE.  The airline has offered nothing to us except to open a complaint file, which is completely useless. Everything about what they have done these TWO times is completely unacceptable and I highly recommend not booking with them. They are a disgrace."

The seats and tables are very dirty. There is no entertainment system so you have to sit bored in your whole flight. There is a lot of noise in the cabins and staff is not responsible, cooperative or helpful. People behind you keep bumping your seat and bathrooms are not clean. Food is fine and leg space is usually very less unless you are travelling in business or first class."

I came to Beijing-Capital by Pakistan International Airlines. My flight ticket was the cheapest economy class. But my seat was Economy plus class. Great!! Fine!! Excellent!! I was never meant to be like this. Because,this is the cheapest round trip ticket between Tokyo and Beijing. Back to Tokyo-Narita,the seat was ordinary economy class. However even this seat had no problem. 2012/5ï¼ŒI visited Beijing for the second time. This time,I took Pakistan International Airlines again;besides,it’s Business class. What are the advantages?? It’s the taste of the air meal. The air meal was so “strong” Pakistani meal. Every ingredient of the “strong” Pakistani meal says “ç§ã¯å°éº¦ã‚ˆ!!(JP)”“æˆ‘æ˜¯é¸¡è‚‰!!(CN)”“I am a carrot!!(EN)”“Sou frango!!(PG)” Their self assertion was so strong like this.

I with my family face a lot of problem during travelling with this airline,Do you guys believe we all were sweating, and they treat business class people well than economy. This type of attitude they have to leave in Pakistan when you know that you are serving your international customers. As compare to the other international flight their price is little bit expensive but they provide the best service"
Jake,"March 20, 2022",Pal Express,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,No,"This is literally the worst airline you can imagine. Get to Manila and the didn’t have my baggage, along with 20 other passengers. I had to wait a whole day for my baggage, no boxers, no change of clothes, no toothbrush. Luckily I carried money on my person. Cost me and extra $120+ just  buy all the essentials and a change of outfits. Then my luggage arrives the next day about 12-1pm and my baggage is clearly damaged. First off I say I paid $100 for you to check my bag, American Airlines didn’t even charge me that they say that charge is strictly for PAL. Delayed my bag a day and saw my bag has a huge rip which wasn’t there before. They eventually say no refund and  and I essentially had to start taking pictures for the worker to file a report of damage.  They denied my claim and my refund. Other horrible honorable mentions. You’re gonna be on a flight for 15 hours without Wi-Fi and they’re gonna change your seat without your consent. Unfortunately I believe this is the only Airline that flies into the Philippines from LAX"

I was on that plane last night 22 April , flight PR211 in Exit seat 44k on its Manila to Sydney flight. On take off and for approximately 7 mins there was a very strong smell of burning oil , enough to sting my eyes. The hostess directly in front of me was looking very worried. I’m not sure if it was reported  to the captain once the seat belt sign was turned off , but she was talking to another hostess about the issue. Maybe today’s emergency landing in Sydney could have been avoided if the young hostess had been listened to at the time. Regards Stewart tattersall"

However, Philippine Airlines made such a huge mess of our plans (both ways) that we had to spend New Year’s eve being sick on the grounds of a very filthy Kalibo airport and finally flying out on New Year’s day, reaching HK just before midnight on 1 Jan. Both routes had been redirected to Kalibo airport, when we actually booked to fly via Caticlan airport.  The fare from HK to caticlan is nearly double the fare from HK to Kalibo and PAL had redirected us both ways to fly Kalibo without any reimbursements of the difference! The many delays, continuous flight cancellations and redirections, total disregard for their customers as they never bothered to make any announcements or updates to their customers, minimal food or water, no offer of assistance when we were stranded and stuck in an unfamiliar place in kalibo, plus the madness and filth we encountered in Kalibo, all added up to making our xmas and new year a horrible and forgettable experience in the Philippines! And now, they are not returning our calls. Philippines airlines, you really cannot continue to scam your passengers this way! You have let us and many many others down!"
MARIA,"April 10, 2014",Pal Express,2.4,Flew Economy,0.0,1,3,1,0,,,1,No,"I am givinng them the lowest rating for a lot of reasons: 1. Flights are always delay, 2. Staff are inefficient and rude, 3. No communication with the passengers. Routes: Manila to Davao on 15/03/2014, Davao to Manila then Manila to Cagayan de Oro on 20/03/2014 (this should be just a direct flight form Davao to Cagayan de Oro instead they decide to cancelled the flight which should only be less than an hour flight). The flights were nightmare coupled with rude staff who doesn’t inform passenger what is going on. The flight from Davao to  Manila on 20/03/20 flight no. PR2812 was delay and because we are catching a connecting to Cagayan de Oro we are worried will not get  there for the staff were not helpful, doesn’t know if the plane will ever arrive. When we get to Manila we have to get 3 shuttle bus rides to get to the plane. During that time just 5 mins before boarding we were asked to changed gate. At that point we thought it will board, instead we have to wait again. While this is all happening no announcement from the staff why all these changes. I spoke to the captain on flight to Cagayan de Oro (PR525) who not only admitted they are not the best airlines, as if that’s something to be proud of, he never apologise for the delay. With that kind of attitude he is not the one for the job. Flight from Cagayn de Oro was no better. Again it’s delay, and when boarding comes passengers just took the initiative without waiting for announcement. One passenger I heard was starving, they have no decency to offer substantial food. We get small pocket of peanuts, about 10 nutsin it and small pocket of plain biscuits. I have completed feedback forms no reply from until I went on Facebook. Will not recommend PAL at all and will not use them at all."

Last March 21, 2014, I came from International flight very tired and exhausted and have scheduled to flew from Manila to Cagayan de Oro took the 10:55 PAL flight.  I checked in my baggage at the counter and I was entertained by two smiling female crew. After the weighing, I paid off an amount of P1,600 for the excess weight even if it was a burden for me. And they treated me nicely. Unfortunately before reaching the final check in counter (x-ray machine), a personnel approached me and insisted to re-weigh my backpack and pay again. Explaining to him that I already paid my extra baggage and that all things inside my pack are my important belongings and I can handle it but he ignored. What I didn’t like this guy was his approach in handling a person. He has that provoking and annoying gestures and he is not fit in the frontline area. I felt disgusted on him and such an evil advocate for me on that day.  Putting a person like him in the front line will cause additional tension to travelers like me who just came from international flight wherein everything is fine. It is better for him to be assigned in the storeroom. Good, that another guy assisted me  and put my stuff in placed. Although I paid off additional amount but due to his approach, he made me calm and put my burden light and easy.  Thanks to him. Please consider my suggestions, Review your personnel attitude. Re-train them in costumer handling, Communication process. When to talk and what to talk so that when they meet people they will know. Right Personnel in designated areas. (Front liners, back liners)."

I have used them on numerous occasions and I have found them to be just a budget airline with very few extras. They have now gone down even further in my opinion for two main reasons. The excess baggage fees have increased 500% to maximise as much profit as possible. It used to be R$2 per Kilo. Now its a whopping R$10 per Kilo. This fee can vary from where you are flying from, so expect to pay more (up to R$15) from some airports. Most people use the airline for either business or a holiday destinations, so the 1 bag of 23 KG per person is nothing for a small family wanting to get away. Its profit all the way with this company. On board you will get nothing to eat and the in flight drink will be a cup of water with 2 lumps of ice."

The seats are a little tight and cramped for a 174cm tall / 95kg guy like myself but the flights are all under an hour and a half. The staff is always pleasant and helpful. No free anything: baggage, food, drinks, seat selection is all up to you. I always bring a bottle of water and a few snacks from home. Biggest difficulty is getting to and from Kansai Int’l Airport for their 7AM flights using public transportation. Also the T2 terminal they fly out of is another 5~10 minutes (free shuttle bus) from the main terminal at KIX."
Peter,"December 28, 2014",Peach Air,3.2,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,0,,,2,No,"Peach 🙁 NEVER AGAIN. Okinawa – Taipei. Nov 10 2014. They let us waiting for a flight and every hour kept saying that the flight will be late. After about 5 hours they announced: flight is CANCELED. Everyone had to go back thru immigration. (what if it was somebody`s last day of visa?)   Than we could either claim money back or fly another day. I decided to take next day, which was full, so I had to stay in Jap. for another two days.  Btw. the first and also the second time I tried to take the flight, I was asked for showing the staff a ticket from Taipei to another country, or they would not let me aboard.  …. That would be a topic for another pretty long story. I even called the police and the next time I really had to push one of the staff who physically did not want to let me on the plane.  So even if I had a ticket from Okinawa to Taipei, they still did`t let me go on the board. I made it, but  you rather not try.  … but can you imagine it? they would let me just stay in jap. without anything, just because they had to obey some stupid company`s rule…. I am just tired of being a Sheep citizen and obey any nonsense rules created by private companies.  The japs seem to be nice people, well until something serious or new appears. Than they start behaving like warriors. Seriously. They always smile, but inside are cruel and rude. If you need more details, my email is    [email protected]"
Mohamad,"August 7, 2023",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Horror…. Please take another Airlines…3 Hours to late and we had to wait in Plane for 3 Hourse!!!! My Baggage was broken and the employees are rude In the Rating one of the most unsafe Airline worldwide Never again
Amjad,"November 15, 2022",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,No,the staff and cabin crew were rude not smiling and not helpful at all. 2 H delays in flight without any notice from airline suddenly no cabin stroller in the cabin although it fits and not crowded plane they weren’t helpful with our 2 years baby and didn’t hand us the stroller on the plane door worst 2 flights of my life. will never book again on this shit company Note: i flew with this company around 10 times
Yara,"September 27, 2021",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,No,"I highly do not recommend Pegasus Airlines. As I was flying back to Beirut from Istanbul, a women from the airlines stopped me at the gate to check the weight of my carry on (that was already approved at the check-in) and obliged me to pay 100$ for the extra 2kg!! She was very mean, impolite, unprofessional and unethical. She was talking to me in an unacceptable was, saying unacceptable words and repeatedly told me that she won’t let me get on board without paying or she will throw away my baggage. On the website of the airline there is no mention of 100$ for 2 extra kg, they don’t answer nor reply. No wonder Pegasus Airlines seems to be the ‘cheapest’ airlines… they know other ways in stealing the client’s money. Surely, no one I know will ever use Pegasus."

The extremely poor customer service of Pegasus Air in Prague, Czech Republic, will assure we will avoid this airline in the future. We traveled from Istanbul to Prague with absolutely no issues. Our return flight was not the same. At the airport, the extremely rude representative refused the very same in cabin bags that we had brought from Istanbul, claiming they were too big. We have taken these same bags in the cabins of every airline we have flown in the last 1.5 years. Not only did she refuse the bags but we were charged 104 Eu.Imagine our frustration when we were boarding the plane and saw many bags as large or larger than ours entering the cabin and being stored in the overhead bins."

Inder,"June 1, 2019",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,3,1,2,1,1,2,1,No,"Flew with them from Istanbul to London. They changed the departure gate without making a clear announcement till quite late. No entertainment or food, which was to be expected, but the seats were the most uncomfortable of any budget airline I’ve ever been on. When we arrived they didn’t bring an air bridge for about 20 minutes and our luggage didn’t arrive until an hour and a bit after getting through passport control. Cheap but still not quite value for money."
Soheil,"July 10, 2018",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,0,No,"Me and my friend had the worst possible experience with Pegasus and Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW) staff; on June 29th 2018 we were going from Bodrum to Tehran and had a few hours stop in Istanbul. As we were waiting at the gate some Pegasus staff showed up and shouted there would be one hour delay, we knew Pegasus didn’t offer meal during the flight so we decided to go to the next snack bar and eat something before boarding. We returned to the gate half an hour later and surprisingly found they had already closed the gate and didn’t allow us to get on the plane although the boarding bridge was still in place and we could see staff getting in and out of the plane which took off 20 minutes later. – There was absolutely no announcements about the time changes or last calls on the Airport speakers – During our exhausting 8 hour stay at Sabiha Gokcen Airport we just struggled to find and communicate to someone who could help or give us some information. Most of the staff, including Pegasus supervisor and Pegasus manager couldn’t or didn’t want to speak English properly, we didn’t speak Turkish so it was really hard to communicate – Most of the staff, including Pegasus supervisor and Pegasus manager weren’t helpful, all they had to say repeatedly was we should pay and buy new tickets for their next day flight – We had to wait from 12:00am to 3:00am before getting the chance to speak to a Pegasus supervisor, an sleepy arrogant young woman who didn’t have the slightest idea what customer appreciation means – The plane had took our luggage to Tehran, so they literally left us, two transit passengers, without our personal belongings in the middle of the night in a city we didn’t have a place to stay – There were at least 2 other Pegasus passengers who had missed their flights almost at the same time I know stories from people who had missed their Air Canada, Lufthansa, Iran Air flights; although they were responsible for being late, every single one received free tickets for the next flight from the airline at the end. Luckily, I could find a Turkish Airline flight from Istanbul Atatürk Airport (IST) to Tehran the next morning and decided to never again fly with Pegasus or any other cheap no-name airlines; few years ago I had another bad experience with EasyJet, another cheap airline, when they charged me 400 Euros for “excessive” luggage while the ticket was only 70 Euros. It really worths to pay slightly more for your ticket and get it from a solid well-known airline which understands the value of their customers and don’t trap you with their tricks and hidden costs."
Ebru,"May 12, 2018",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,,,1,No,"After a motorcycle accident in Indonesia and a 20-hour journey with a stitched wound on my arm, sprained foot and chest, which I informed the check-in agent as well as her supervisor about, I was sent to the sales counter to pay for 1(!) kg of excess baggage worth 8 TL / 2 USD.

Mikhail,"January 19, 2018",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,3,2,3,,,2,No,This booking was a fraud. When you book a Business Flex ticket it says very clear that it can be refunded without a fee. For free. I had to cancel my booking for reason on time (more than 24 hours in advance). I was charged something around 30 EUR. When I was canceling the booking the website was in English except for one string in Turkish saying I have to pay 30 EUR with no chance to unflag this option. The support was helpless (number 00359078). It’s a very primitive “fraud” changing my attitude to the air company forever. The ratings for flying experience are based on my previous trips with Pegasus

Iain,"January 7, 2017",Pegasus,2.3,Flew Economy,2.0,3,2,1,1,,,0,No,Have flown Pegasus many times over last two years through their Istanbul hub to & from U.K. & Sharm. I had no problems until my last three flights all of which were delayed resulting in missed connections. A noticeable drop in customer service has also occurred with uninterested & rude staff now the norm. Lounge staff at their Istanbul hub worst I’ve experienced in many years of travel. Will no longer use this airline & would not recommend it to others.

I have flown all over the world and have never had such an atrocious experience with any other airline in my life.  This flight was leg three of my trip which had begun at 8:00 a.m. the morning of June 27th.  The flight was set to depart Boston for Presque Isle, Maine at 5:05 p.m.  This time came and went with no updates from anyone as to why we weren’t boarding.  Finally, much past take off time we were informed that there was a mechanical issue with our plane but no new boarding time was set.  We were in a tiny terminal in the basement of Logan Airport and could see the mechanics working on our plane for hours including replacing tires (I have pictures to support this).  Right next to our plane was another Pen Air plane, Flight 0127 also headed to Presque Isle.  As hours passed by, regular updates were given about Flight 127 as it was delayed due to weather.  Nothing was being announced about 129 so several of us went up to ask why.  There was no information available aside from saying they were still working on the plane which we could clearly see.  No attempts were b"

Moli,"July 6, 2023",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,5,5,3,4,4,5,Yes,"I always enjoy flying in a Philippine Airlines flight. The overall service was exceptional, with incredibly friendly and hospitable staff who provided world-class service. The food they served was delightful. However, one area that could use improvement is the availability of entertainment on certain international flights. It would be wonderful if Philippine Airlines expanded their destinations to include more locations in the Middle East and Europe. The only downside to the experience was the NAIA airport."
John,"June 26, 2023",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,"Philippine Airlines is the WORST airline ever!

Ralph,"April 11, 2023",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,3,2,1,2,No,"Canceled my flight and did not refund my funds, despite repeated request. I had to file a complaint with the FAA to get them to respond and finally refund most of my money. When I booked with them later on a flight from Honolulu to Manila, they forced everyone on the flight at the last minute to buy flight insurance, which is illegal. Of course it was a disaster and the flight was delayed as passengers were standing around on their phones trying to find a carrier and show proof…. They stop this requirement after so many complaints but never offered an apology or refund."

Steve,"November 3, 2021",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,No,"Sadly, they covid cancelled May 2020 flights UK to Manila and internal.

janet,"March 31, 2020",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"A highly frustrating experience caused by Philippine Airlines being irresponsible on two separate occasions. First, by changing my 2 hour layover to a 12 hour overnight one without offering any compensation (as required by EU law), nor accommodation. Then, by not refunding me on time for this cancelled flight. It is now 40 days after the cancelled flight and no money to be seen. No responses to emails, calls are a waste of time. Have called them for hours now. They put you on hold, pass you from person to person, and when they are asked for proof that the payment has gone through, they cut the line."
Gary,"June 18, 2019",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,7.0,3,1,4,2,3,4,3,No,Constantly  striving to improve service  on time performance remains an issue and aircraft are basic and uncomfortable.
Giovanni,"May 5, 2019",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,No,"I prepaid my extra luggage online and printed my booking reference where it stated how much extra luggage allowance I have. At the checkin counter in Manila they told me they have no record of my extra luggage. When I showed them my receipt I was advised I need the “real” receipt apparently sent by email. Nobody could tell me why my booking reference included the extra luggage. No arguing or discussion with supervisor and on-site manager helped. Because I had not prepaid according to them the double-rate applied. Absolutely abysmal! Sheer highway robbery! What an airline and what management. I will avoid these guys in future! So for ripping me off an extra 3,000 Peso they lost much more in future business."

Inflight food average 4/10. Cabin crew service is poor as they don’t attend passengers needs such as giving out water after meal service. Passengers left dehydrated for a 15 hour straight flight and no mi flight snacks served as indicated on their inflight menu. Economy class passengers received poor service compared to thier Business Class. Cabin crews are nowhere to found after every meal service. Inflight Entertainment is 2/10 and the same movies I’ve watched 1 year ago. Wifi on board not working on their B777-300er."
Jessica,"May 17, 2018",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"London to Manila. We booked flights for Thursday 7th June. 3 weeks before our flight date we have been told that the flight is cancelled and we either have to fly a day later and miss the wedding or a day earlier and have to take unpaid leave and deal with work complications because of it. If we had known before we would have chosen a different airline, however 3 weeks before the flight date flights have sky rocketed in price and suitable flights not available so is not an option. What’s more the flights we now were cheaper at the time of booking so we have now also overpaid for a flight we did not want. No compensation or apology from Philippines Airlines so far. Very poor service and terrible reliability."
Maximo Jr.,"April 2, 2018",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,3,4,2,,,4,Yes,It was my first time to fly on our flag carrier on a Manila-Singapore-Manila flight. PR511 is an Airbus A321-200 with no seat-back entertainment system so I have to be content on reading the Mabuhay Magazine for a 3 hour journey. Maybe the pilot missed the distance of lowering the plane’s altitude on our final approach to Changi Airport so the aircraft suddenly dives and it was a hair raising experience but the landing was smooth. On my return leg to Manila on PR508 they used an old Airbus A330-300 and still with no seat back entertainment. Both airplanes are equipped with on-board wifi using pre-downloaded PAL apps but I am not a fan of using mobile devices while travelling because it makes me dizzy. When we arrived at Terminal 2 there were no airbridge available so all 300+ passengers have to go down on stairs at the tarmac and transported inside by several buses. It was like arriving from a domestic flight on a budget carrier. I don’t feel that 4 star Skytrax rating in terms of equipment. Overall… it was a good experience and hoping for a better journey next time.
Iñigo,"February 12, 2018",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,3,5,4,,,4,Yes,"I flew Philippine Airlines from MNL to LHR on a Boeing 777-300ER on the first week of February after being recommended by a friend. Yes, fares were so cheap, great value for money. Although I understand the airline is undergoing improvements, I would like to point out that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done on their cabin and seats—from ambience down to seat comfort. I hope they will soon opt for a total makeover of their cabins or else their great service will just be marred by a bad environment. Remember, first impressions last, for some. Honestly, I don’t like the airport in MNL but I am not traveling to see airports though. But what made my flight great were the people. They were extremely attentive and friendly, without looking orchestrated, that I even made friends with two of the staffs. And also, no offense but what sets them apart from other Asian carriers I flew before was how proficient they were in English, I did not have difficulty communicating with them. I was also surprised with how flexible their meal selections were for an economy class flight. The IFE is not that bad but still needs upgrading. It could be better if it will have screens like the ones I flew with on Emirates coupled with a responsive UX similar to SIA’s KrisWorld which I really have appreciated. All in all, I would love to recommend it to my relatives who plan to go to Palawan, the Philippines for their vacation next month."
PE,"February 12, 2018",Philippine Airlines,6.3,Flew Business Class,6.0,3,4,4,4,,,4,Yes,"I am a Filipino based in Riyadh, normally flies with PAL to Manila or via Manila. I have flown with PAL on business class to MNL, SYD, SFO, NRT and my experience varies as PAL uses different type of aircraft per destination. On their 10hrs Riyadh flights they are using A330 bi-class with 18 full flat business class seats with unworkable wifi and no IFE, instead they provide iPad upon request with limited selection of movies. Inflight service is good but meals not as great as US bound flights. On their 8hrs Sydney flight on an old A340 (now A330 TriClass) business class with no IFE, iPad upon request instead, seats not fully flat but comfy. On their 14hr flight to SanFrancisco they are using the new B777 with updated IFE with 3D map in every seat, meal service with attention to details. On my business class trip to Tokyo NRT on an A330TriClass, i can say this is the best product they have with all aisle access 1-2-1 seating, Wide HD IFE in every seat, but no amenity kit and no pre-arrival meal for 4hrs flying time. Other Asian carriers provide full amenity kit on business class even for 2hrs flying time. Still has alot to be improved to achieve atleast 4stars. Mode lighting should be installed as it makes a difference in cabin. Outside camera should be added. Mabuhay Lounge at T2 is pretty ordinary. T1 still no Lounge access for Elite/Business class passengers bound to Middle East but they provide voucher for Starbucks only. There should be atleast 2 toilets on A330 business class (currently only 1). B777 business class seating should be 2-2-2 or 1-2-1 like Cathay, still they have 2-3-2. Hope their A350 will be at par with other Asian carriers."
Stefania,"May 4, 2023",Play,8.0,Flew Economy Class,8.0,4,4,5,1,4,5,4,Yes,"Play is a low cost airline,  so the tickets are fairly cheap – BUT be ready for extra cost if you want to travel with any baggage. Included in the price is only one personal item like backapack, that will have to fit under the seat. They have self check-in at Keflavik Airport which is nice. Seats are comfortable and foot space is fine compared to other low cost airlines. Staff on board is very nice. There is no TV’s, wifi or chargers on board though. Overall a good flight, might reconsider high cost for luggage though."
Clay,"August 9, 2023",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,3,0,,1,4,No,"Had an absolutely horrible experience with a trip booked through the Air Transat website, with a connecting flight operated by Porter.  Total fail by both companies!  When showing up for initial flight operated by Air Transat, was refused boarding and handed a phone number to try to fix it.  After about a half hour on hold and speaking to heavily accented employee, found that they’d changed my booking to several days later.  No emails, no notice whatsoever, no offers of compensation, nothing.  If that wasn’t bad enough, when I eventually took the flight they rebooked me on, upon arrival at ticketing for the second leg of my trip (this time operated by Porter), I was again refused boarding.  This time they said I owed them a large sum of money (twice the price of flights booked) and would not be allowed to board until it was paid.  Upon contacting both Air Transat and Porter (both at ticketing and through their phone line), both claimed it was the other’s fault.  Spend hours dealing with them, missed the flight, and eventually had no choice but to give in to their extortion."
Bob,"June 12, 2023",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,3,2,0,,,0,No,Terrible experience.  Flight delayed 20 minutes but landed within 15 minutes of making connection.   Would not allow us to board and rescheduled flight 9 hours later.  They had multiple opportunities to rebook us and help us arrive at destination much earlier.   They refused government specified compensation.   Will be taking them to court.
Steve,"March 4, 2023",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,0,2,3,1,No,Just another scam. One of their big selling points is that they offer free wine and beer on flights. I’m over 2 hours into my flight and I am unable to obtain a 2nd beer. This happens to be one of my trips where I won’t be driving after the flight today so I was looking forward to  relaxing with a couple of drinks before getting to Edmonton  but at 67 years of age maybe they feel that one beer is my limit. I’d be more than happy to pay for the “free ” drinks and at least have one when I care to. If I want to be treated like crap I might as well go back to Swoop or Flair. At least the poor service is cheaper. I’ll be canceling the return portion of my trip and certainly won’t be flying with these scammers again anytime soon.
Ray,"August 15, 2022",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,No,WORST airline in Canada.  Avoid at all costs.  They cancel flight (on clear days) with no explanation and offer no help and no compensation.  I’ve had a vacation ruined by these feelingless zombies.
Chantal,"January 27, 2019",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,0,No,"I have never received such terrible customer service in my life. My flight from Moncton to Ottawa was cancelled due to weather conditions (understandable) and I was sent an email asking not to contact Porter, stating that they would contact me with the next available flight information. I waited for hours and heard nothing from them. I ended up heading to the airport in hopes that I would be able to get on to the next flight that was going out. When I was told no, I asked when the next available flight was and they told me 8 days from when I was supposed to fly out…. they told me I should have phoned them because everyone else did and were able to get onto the next outgoing flights. Though, the email stated NOT to contact them. And apparently, they had no intention on contacting me either. I ended up having to get a 24 hour, $200 train ticket to get home. To top it off, I received terrible customer service from EVERYONE and was told they would not compensate me in any way for this terrible and costly inconvenience. Plus, my flight TO Moncton was delayed by several hours. Actually, I have taken Porter 4 times in my life and each and every time, my flight has been delayed. This has caused me to miss $60 busses, $100 trains, book hotels in random cities…etc. Basically, yes Porter is cheap…but by the time you pay for missing your transportation (not to mention the time you spend waiting on a delayed airplane) it’s just not worth the penny pinching. Spend the money and fly with an airline that actually cares about you, treats you well, and gets you to where you need to go (on time!)"
Jaime,"October 14, 2018",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,Yes,"Porter cancelled my flight without warning at 6:30am 30 minutes before the flight was supposed to leave. 20 minutes before my flight was supposed to leave, I received an email saying that I had been automatically rescheduled to another Halifax-Toronto flight taking place 3.5 days later. Other would-be passengers received emails saying they were put on flights a week late. Finally, when a customer service rep showed up when takeoff was scheduled, she told us all we could do was go to the front desk and be refunded if we didnt want to take the flight Porter had automatically put us on. I waited in a very long line to talk to a customer service rep who was very unsympathetic and offered me no option except a refund, which I had to accept because I only arranged to spend the weekend in Halifax. I should also add that none of the passengers were given any explanation for the cancellation and when I asked, the rep said that a one member of the crew had called in sick. The flights to Toronto with other airlines at the airport were $700-900, which was much more expensive than the $339 ticket from Porter that I had purchased weeks before. 800 number where someone may or may not cover some of the cost. I ended up having to take the bus from Halifax to Toronto since there were no affordable flights and I needed to get to Toronto for school, work and appointments within the next 36 hours. Both the situation and Porter’s follow-up were unacceptable and I would advise against booking with them."
Aidan,"September 4, 2018",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,4,,,5,Yes,"The flight I took with Porter originated in Windsor and finished in Montreal, with one stop in Toronto City — but no plane change. We departed early in Windsor, and even though the flight to Toronto was less than an hour the very friendly flight crew still came through the cabin with a complimentary drink and snack service. We landed on time in Toronto and only waited appx. 10 minutes until a gate was freed up. Passengers only completing the Windsor-Toronto leg deplaned, and Montreal bound passengers loaded. The flight was not full, the seats were very spacious (I got a whole row going to Toronto, but even with a seat mate going to Montreal I still had plenty of space) Definately a good and cost effective alternative to Air Canada, considering that I had no transfers as well. Very good job, Porter!"
Sega,"November 4, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy Class,9.0,4,3,5,0,,,5,Yes,"I fly them regularly between Montreal and Toronto for business. Service quality is consistently higher than competitors, especially Air Canada, though I concede it has gone downhill over the past couple of years, with the introduction of additional baggage and ancillary fees and the reduction of call centre staff. They eliminated meals and started serving only snacks, though I still love the free coffee and cookies in the Toronto lounge. They also cancel flights quite often for capacity / load reasons. But the staff are always polite and helpful, the cabin comfort is good for short-haul, and the free wine or craft beer on every flight is a nice perk. One of the main advantages has always been been that Porter treats everyone — frequent fliers and occasional travellers — like a human being, versus competitors who will barely acknowledge you as more than dirt on their shoe unless you’re a super-elite status flyer. The introduction of a tiered system on VIPorter this year is a step on the wrong direction, so I hope this continues. For now I’ll continue to rate Porter highly, though it’s a cautionary rating."
H,"August 16, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,0,,,3,No,When we originally booked this flight we were told there was only one stop. They never told us about the touchdown in Ottawa that added an extra 2 hours to our flight to Toronto. Once in Toronto we were delayed 2 1/2 hours due to “weather” to get to our final destination. The Porter lounge in Billy Bishop Airport is small and because most of their planes were delayed was crowded and many people did not even have a place to sit. There was only 1 place to purchase food and the food was terrible and extremely overpriced. Our flight home was even worse. We were delayed in Newark for 7 hours and by the time we reached Toronto we had missed our connecting flight to Halifax. No one at Porter was any help to us and we were left to fend for ourselves by finding a hotel (luckily our travel agent was able to help us) This was on a Wednesday and Porter rebooked us on flights going home Friday and Saturday with the hotel expense coming out of our pocket. We did not find that acceptable and booked a flight with a different airport the following day. Porter has advised they will not reimburse our portion of the flight from Toronto to Halifax which we did not use. If you plan to use Porter airline
Trish,"August 16, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,2,0,,,4,No,I will think long and hard before I use the services of porter. Today when I checked in for my flight I was told that another flight was booked under my name. I had never received an itinerary and the flights were booked on line and only 14 minutes apart. I did not know that two flights were booked so I didn’t know to cancel. I have been on the phone for 4.5 hours trying to get my money back. I was told it was my problem. So far in July I have flown with porter three times return to the states and Sault Ste Marie. During this time I have been delayed more than 5 hours and on a phone 4.5 hours. I received one leg returned to my credit card. I don’t think I will be flying with porter unless I am desperate in the future. I have been a good client and this is how they treat me.
Michael,"August 16, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Worst airline ever, my wife drove from Montreal to Toronto to fly to Chicago, traffic was extremely busy the entire way, rep on the phone said have her still go to the counter and pay an additional same day change fee for $150, he did mention their discretion and noted her situation in their computer in good faith, but they declined. They said a one way route was an additional $250 to $ 450!!! Good business? We would pay the additional $150 to get my wife home!  Never use them again!!!!"
a,"August 16, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,2.0,2,3,3,0,,,3,No,This airline is terribly unreliable. You’re almost guaranteed to have a delay of at least an hour. They never tell you in advance so your stuck at an airport. No valid reasons are given either. Weather at both locations are fine but flights are delayed by 2 hours. Don’t fly this airline if you need to be somewhere at a particular time
Martin,"August 16, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,4,1,,,4,No,I booked a flight from Newark to Toronto. On my arrival in Newark I was told the flight was cancelled due to rain in Toronto and they had rebooked me on another flight 2 days later !!! 2 days later?? I say how’s that possible ? They said nothing could be done at counter that I needed to call. So I called and waited on the phone for 3 hrs to have someone pick up and hang up on me! Called again and waited 2 hrs to have to same thing happened to me. I called a Third time and waited 2 hrs and still no answers by that time I gave up and went to bed. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced
Mark,"July 20, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Do not fly Porter airlines! Absolutely brutal service today. First and last time flying Porter for us. Returning on a flight from Boston today and our flight was delayed ( it happens, we get it). We were already at the airport waiting and asked to board a Porter flight leaving before our fight that was delayed and were told we had to wait as the flight was sold out. No problem, we step aside and start to wait. While we are waiting more passengers from our flight come up and ask to take the earlier flight and the same attendant tells them it full and to wait in the line that we were at the front of. There turns out to be 3 seats left and we thought great. The same attendant who asked us to wait then proceeds to take 2 people in front of me and my 11 year old son waiting. He then turns to us and says they needed to go first. Is it because we didn’t raise our voice so and yell/ screen? We waited for another 10 minutes thinking we were next as the counter staff talked. I then asked are there any more seats and was told the flight has left. Not even the courtesy to tell us as we stood 2 feet from the desk. Don’t fly this airline! You will be next."
Jane,"June 20, 2017",Porter Airlines,3.6,Flew Economy,1.0,2,2,3,1,,,4,No,"After a 5h delay, we weren’t able to meet the Toronto city airport curfew and were taken to Hamilton, ON, where we had to wait for another 1.5h to get on a bus to downtown Toronto (another hour ride). The staff was uninformative and inflexible with the drop off location and passengers were dropped off at 3 am near Union Station. We were only informed of the airport changes after boarding, and since it was an international flight some of us had to internet or phone line to communicate with your families of the changes. A 1.5h quick flight from BOS to Toronto city became a 10h headache."
Joao,"August 15, 2015",Portugalia Airlines,9.0,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,5,4,,,5,Yes,Portugalia is a subsidiary company of TAP. The planes are quite old and small (Embraers and Fokkers) but the service is excellent and the quality is good enough to feel confortable.

Peter,"January 7, 2024",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,2,1,3,2,3,1,No,"Travelled back from New Zealand in December on a code share with Air New Zealand. Air NZ to Melbourne then QF to Perth. Flight to Perth was delayed by 6 hours (surprise, surprise) but worse, even though I had a boarding pass with QF769 on it and have been a Qantas Club member for 20 years, they wouldn’t allow me in the lounge because I booked the flight with Air NZ. The flight home with lunch slopped in a cardboard box and sassy stewardesses was all very poor. If Vanessa Hudson says she wants to improve the customer experience the message is absolutely not getting through to the front line workers. Just appalling airline and will always look for an alternative from now on. Oh, and by the way, ALL qantas staff should be required to take a flight on Air NZ to see how a great airline does it !! Just chalk and cheese"
Gary,"January 7, 2024",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,6.0,2,4,3,3,4,4,2,No,"Ongoing poor service, I however acknowledge an effort appears to be being made. In flight service is far less than optimum for a full-service airline particularly food."

Vincent,"August 9, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Premium Economy Class,2.0,1,3,2,3,1,1,3,No,They are barely a full service carrier now. One of the worst airlines on earth. Have flown them for 40-years and watched their steady decline over the years since being privatised.
Jacob,"June 26, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,3,2,,1,3,No,"Broken business class seat wouldnt recline, no compensation, no proper apology.  had an overnight 12 hour flight with no ability to sleep … in business.  Ridiculous."
Cameron,"June 19, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,No,"The multiple legs of travel done with Qantas over the past few months has been some of the worst experiences in travel I’ve had period. The staff are unable to answer simple questions and give completely wrong and Contradictory answers. Flights have been delayed with no explanation or updates given to passengers. Staff are sassy, rude and confrontational when asking for help. This trip will be my last with Qantas. I feel like me and the passengers were treated like cattle."
Brendan,"June 12, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,2,3,1,,1,0,No,"Booked using QFF points in September 22 for trip in May 23. Had a booking reference, emails advising of updates to flights , showing showing in my App. Got to check in to be told we owe $1050.00. Had to pay it to get on plane. We are so disappointed but grateful I guess that we had saved some money for the holiday that we could use to at least get there to spend time with my family."
Michael,"April 11, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,5.0,2,2,3,5,5,5,1,No,"I flew with Qantas from Singapore to Melbourne on the overnight flight – red eye they call it. On take-off at night,  Qantas does not dim or turn off the bright cabin lights. This is disappointing and not safe. There was no proper supper service as such, with no wines or beer offered, we were just HANDED a hot cardboard box that contained a horrible pastry thing that I could not eat. The serving trays are gone.  I threw it away. Qantas has NO mask mandate (apparently customers complained, so they scrapped it – making money is more important than protecting passengers from COVID). Many people were coughing and there was very little actual service from the attendants. The seats are smaller now. The heating was turned low for the flight and it was quite cold on board. The plane was an old A330. I think it is time to update.  The breakfast served was quite fine thank you. I caught Covid-19 so I was NOT happy with this flight  – considering MANY people were coughing. I will NOT fly Qantas ever again."
Nicholas,"March 4, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,1,,0,No,"Qantas cancelled our flight two years ago and still has not refunded us the hundreds of dollars in excess baggage we paid for. I’ve spoken to them about this many times, and they don’t deny they owe us the money; they just say someone will get back to us about it, and no one ever does."
Hedgehog,"January 5, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Business Class,9.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,Yes,"Best airline in the world. Good service, safe. Flew Sydney to London stopping Singapore. Qfa1 and qfa2 not late at all. The food wasn’t too nice though."
Jeff,"January 4, 2023",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,6.0,2,2,4,1,4,4,3,Yes,Over the years I have flown with Qantas and other Australian airlines within Australia and overseas. I am a Gold FF so do benefit from accessing the lounge in Australia and New Zealand. My recent flight from Melbourne to Auckland is pretty typical of what you can expect with limited competition. Qantas only use B737 on this service so you’re not getting state of the art planes they are older aircraft and for what they charge is pretty average for a 3 1/2 hour flight.
Stephen,"December 13, 2022",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,4,3,3,4,3,1,No,QF! sydney to london…very average for post covid…not much better than Qantas domestic but then your only stuck on that for 1 to 4 hours. Reminded me why I dont fly qantas….at least the fare was relatively cheap and it seemed safe.
Joseph,"November 3, 2022",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,We double booked a flight for an employee so we cancelled one flight.
Sam,"November 3, 2022",Qantas,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,4,4,4,2,1,4,No,"I tried to book online and the website crashed. I called Qantas and booked directly, the agent entered my name (Warner, not exactly unusual) incorrectly despite me spelling it twice."
Ian,"December 1, 2017",Qantaslink,5.7,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,0,Yes,"My wife and I travelled on flight QF653 which was the last flight of the day. I walked into the lounge and advised my wife that we should jus sit close by the nearest way out to the gate. My wife got me some food and drink, we had two hours to wait for our pllane. The reason I sat near the way out is I have a problem walking which is usually not a problem.. I do not usuallly have a problem walking so never requested a wheeel chair. However as soon as I stood up to go to the gate as boarding had started, I said to my wife I need a wheel chair. She said, it is too late. I spoke with the man on the desk, he picked dip the telephone spoke with someone else and ordered a wheel chair. He also advised every thing would be fine. A chair arrived as said, I was wheeled to the door of the aircraft, then the staff on board escorted and helped me to my seat. While on board I slept so no cod or drink to score. Time to land the staff were terrific checking I was ok and assisted meson to the wheelchair, once on it I was pushed to the bag collection area. I am writing this to thank the people (who’s names I don’t know) and would like to thank them, for their help and care, from the man at the Buisiness centre to the staff on the plane and the man at Perth."

Flight delayed 10 minutes but information was prompt. A surprise to receive a snack-box and beer, wine, etc for a mid-afternoon flight. Pleasant staff and a comfortable flight."
Richard,"April 21, 2017",Qantaslink,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,2,3,5,0,,,2,No,"Very disappointed we booked Qantas but found out we got Qantas link a regional airline but the flight was from Brisbane to Adelaide hardly regional. the plane was an old second hand B717-200 a variant of the old Douglas DC-9,  bit cramped,  but by far the most shocking was the noise i have never experienced such an incredible loud noise inside an aircraft . i asked the air-hostess if she had any ear muffs she smiled and said no but that it was really noisy sorry."
Richard,"April 18, 2017",Qantaslink,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,5,0,,,3,No,QANTAS AIRWAYS B 717-200 Had no idea that Qantas had such old and dilapidated aircraft in service it was quite a shock. The seat area was small and legroom cramped.but the most terrible part was the excruciating noise levels.on this plane.I  dont like to complain but this was no joke I had seat no 18 so i pity poor people back of me.
jackie,"March 11, 2017",Qantaslink,5.7,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,3,3,,,3,No,QF1579 sunshine coast to maroochydore is unreliable. Avoid qantas to the sunshine coast as they dly the most unreliable planes on this flight. No courtesy when disruptions occur. They hide behind qantaslink and pass the buck
Michael,"August 26, 2016",Qantaslink,5.7,Flew Business,7.0,4,5,5,1,,,5,Yes,"Flew Brisbane/Townsville on B717 business seat. Revamped interior is great, seats are comfortable, cabin staff are attentive,  good choice of meals.  On this flight for some unknown reason no IPads were supplied so I was unable to view any inflight entertainment. Crew were unable to say why no IPads were loaded with the aircraft. This marred what I think is a great product for regional travel with the B717 a very comfortable aircraft."
Michael,"July 18, 2016",Qantaslink,5.7,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,I flew from Brisbane to Newcastle on 14JUL16 by Dasg 8-400. Halfway into the trip the plane had to return to Brisbane with technical problems. Upon landing within 20 minutes we had been transferred to a back up aircraft and were airborne again with 1/2 an hour. Excellent service which reduced our disruption on the trip to a minimum.  Staff kept us informed on what was happening and were efficient and polite.

Only three cabin crew on the B717, with the cabin supervisor handling the people at the pointy end.  Pre-flight water or juice offered, and once the seat belt sign was off, light refreshment was served – the same options as the standard QF flight, three choices a soup, a sandwich or a retro style prawn salad. IFE is via QF iPad which wasnt great, most of the flight I was waiting for shows to load or buffer, in the end I gave up.

My wife and I had a flight scheduled from London to Jakarta with a layover in Doha. Upon arriving at Heathrow and beginning our check-in process, we were informed that our tickets from Doha to Jakarta had been cancelled. A subsequent interaction with a Qatar Airways representative further muddled the situation as they informed us that it was our London to Doha flight that had been cancelled, not the latter."
Jordan,"August 9, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Business Class,1.0,2,4,4,5,1,4,5,No,The service onboard was enjoyable. The customer service afterwards has been horrid. I am still trying to get reimbursed from essential items I had to purchase while Qatar Airways located my luggage and eventually sent it to me 5 days later. I had important business meeting during this 5 day span. This trip was 7 months ago and I filed all of the required paperwork for the reimbursement. Using their online chat is extremely slow and I have had zero results from using it. Calling their generic phone number also takes a lot of time. I’m forced to explain my entire scenario to someone that can not access my case information and can only tell me that customer service will email. They have yet to email me. I’m beyond disappointed with the company and will never fly on them again.
Ashfaq,"June 12, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,1,0,4,4,3,4,No,"Our experience changed from good to worst,when we chose to fly my parents who are senior citizens, we’re treated not as per the claims Qatar airways make, booked preselected paid seats were cancelled last minute with no initiation. Staff at airport lied that bulkhead seats have been given from Doha to Oslo. Despite 100s of tweets and emails, they are still investigating, they keep shifting blame on their system, sometimes on agent and sometime they completely forget what my complain was. Airline is overwhelmed with customers therefore the quality has degraded. Never going to travel again.,"
Daniele,"June 12, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"OMG, they are amazing. Love, Love, Love them. Across board, the staff, crew, couldn’t be more helpful and with the biggest smiles. Welcome drinks, a speciality. The gifts beautifully presented. Selection of warm nuts and after, the dinner blew me away. All beautifully set out and the delicate aroma and taste were of Michelin starred quality.  The comfort of the seats and with the duvet etc slept with peace. The plane was still the old design but hoping for the long haul back, they deign us with the new model interior. Am excited for the end of the month now, when I leave. Plus a huge shout-out to Sara and Pimyada, the most delightful, funny, helpful cabin crew. QR292/04.04.23. See you soon."
Craig,"May 23, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,0,4,4,2,2,3,No,"I have purchased a number of Qatar QSuites, although more than half the time, Qatar downgraded the plane to an older-style business class… once very old. Of course, they do not apologize for this but refer you to the fine print. My last flight was a QSuite but my chair was broken… and it was broken in a very uncomfortable position that ended up causing me a lot of neck and back pain. It was a horrible flight. Having spent $3650, in lieu of this long and terribly uncomfortable flight that led to a migraine, they offered me 7000 Axios point, which basically covers a cup of coffee. Their customer service is horrible… and they never take care of you… and I am Platinum! So, if you don’t have Gold/Platinum, know that they will never take responsibility for the problems you experience. Check-in was full of mistakes, causing me to have to wait for a corrected ticket, all the business class luggage came out after all the economy… and, while their prices are going up, their food quality has definitely come down a few notches as well. ALL very sad."

K,"March 4, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,1,4,4,,4,2,No,"Rather disappointed with this airline. I believe it was better in the past. For starters, the Call Centers give wrong information. The flight of ours for a domestic flight connecting to their international flight was cancelled. Yet Qatar never informed us of that. Also, the food has decreased in quantity. Also, they come around with ONE round of drinks. NO tea or coffee post meal."
Ina,"March 4, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,4,4,3,1,4,3,No,"Unfortunately, my luggage did not arrive in Melbourne.

When I went to the airport to collect my luggage, I was told it was already in the van, which is on its way somewhere in the city and will be brought to me tomorrow. 12 days later I still have no info where it is and when I will get it back.

Dario,"March 1, 2023",Qatar Airways,7.2,Flew Economy Class,5.0,2,1,5,3,,4,3,Yes,Qatar is a good airline but the seats in economy are terrible.  I was in total pain after just a couple of hours into a very long flight.  It felt like I was sitting on a plastic seat with minimal covering.

I was informed that my fragile item could not be carried on board as I had hoped. Despite the item being meticulously packed with layers of bubble wrap and cardboard corners, I had to check it in as luggage, delay of 1 ½ hours before our flight to Sydney, we faced another hour-long delay before continuing to our final destination. No baggage claim carousels were labelled with flight information, Upon retrieving my other bags, I discovered that my fragile item was missing, located fragile item (framed graduation photos/memorabilia) only to find that the glass had been shattered and the item itself damaged. Seeking assistance, we were directed upstairs since there were no Rex staff in the baggage service area, also called for assistance using a courtesy phone. A Rex rep eventually appeared and performed a cursory examination of the damaged item. We were informed that the item’s fragility meant they held no liability for the damage."

My wife and I flew Sydney from Melbourne with Rex on Thursday 20/07/2023 (Our first-time experience with Rex Airline and definitely will be the last one). We had two checked bag which didn’t show up one of those (my wife’s one) in Sydney. It was shocking and stressful time for us, especially for my wife because she had all her stuffs, medicines and laptop with all her information inside her suitcase. We came back home but with a horrible condition. Also, my wife is under ongoing treatment (depression and anxiety) and this type of unexpected scenario plays as a negative impact on her mood and is a poison for her health. On 21/07/2023, received phone call from Rex Airline, and they mentioned a shocking news that our baggage sent to North Territory last night instead to Sydney! They said, this evening will be sent to Brisbane and after that will be in Sydney. You can imagine how was our feeling by hearing that news.

Zunaeed,"June 26, 2023",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,Yes,"Unbelievable Service! Better than Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar. For the first time, I booked Rex to fly from Canberra to Melbourne. It was a good deal with luggage and I took it. When checking in, it was lovely Mandy, who greeted me with a big smile. She checked me in and I was on my way to go to my gate. Later, while I was waiting for the call, Mandy came and gave me an upgrade to their business class. She knew that I was going to Pilgrimage to Mecca and she wanted me to have a good trip! I was very grateful. Upon boarding, I was presented with this clean aircraft with friendly crew. I was surprised to see how professional and courteous they were. Overall, that was a very enjoyable flight. All flights should be like this. I will definitely fly again with Rex."
MARTIN,"May 9, 2023",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,No,"Overpriced airline that hardly is on time. Charges you extra for basic seats, and for every kg over 15kg allowance to then leave you luggage behind. No help if you miss your connection due to their terrible performance."
marcus,"April 11, 2023",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,4,4,5,4,Yes,Changing to an earlier flight was easily done for a small fee. The convenience was exceptional and a welcomed relief. Service was great with natural charm. Refreshments were simple and satisfying for the short flight. Very satisfying experience.
Hadleigh,"April 4, 2022",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,5,0,5,4,4,Yes,I flew Rex for the first time last year from Adelaide to Melbourne on the new Boeing 737 and I must say that I was very impressed with their service and the flight attendants were very friendly and funny and the snacks were good. I will be definitely for flying them again.
Zig,"October 12, 2021",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy Class,2.0,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,No,"Not for families with kids. Unlike ALL other airlines, Rex includes the stroller, highchair, carseat, in the baggage allowance for kids over 2years old who must have their own seat. Considering the weight of the average stroller and carseat, there is little to no allowance left for the child’s toys, food, books, nappies, and the heap of equipment needed to care for infants/toddlers. All other airlines allow you to take at least 2 of these items with you IN ADDITION to the baggage allowance. I enjoyed flying with Rex and told them that we simply can’t fly with them as we could not bring what we need for our child with us. We told them that this unfriendly policy toward families would hurt their image as it is out of step with the norm. No doubt the new airline Bonza that will launch next year will be more understanding and flexible toward families and those with special needs."
Maureen,"January 25, 2017",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy,10.0,3,4,5,3,,,3,Yes,My husband and I flew REX from Kingscote to Adelaide on 21st January 2017. The flight attendant was the happiest and friendliest young woman who obviously loved her work. She was so professional. We fly  up to 30 times a year on airlines from all over the world this attendant was proud to do her job. Well done.
Michael,"January 18, 2016",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy,9.0,5,4,5,0,,,2,Yes,"Rex is a regional airline with few frills but with a price to match.  Compared to QantasLink, the competitor on most of Rex’s routes, Rex usually wins, hands down, on costs.  They tend to be better in maintaining schedules.  Yes, the food is not as great as Qantas and the planes are smaller but on the other hand their planes fit under the security limit for country airports so boarding is MUCH quicker than Qantas."
Bill,"October 22, 2015",Rex Australia,5.4,Flew Economy,3.0,1,2,3,0,,,1,No,Terrible transfers at sydney. Bus waits and picks up passengers from more than one flight. Takes half as long to get to terminal as it did for the flight

I paid for an extra luggage online and yet they told me to pay an additional 2100dhs at the airport for reasons I don’t understand. They gave me attitude and spoke to me badly. Only after I got irritated and asked to speak to a supervisor did they decide to resolve the issue. The flight attendants were Great but the aircraft smelled like a toilet, and the food was bad.

If I call the customer service I get always the statement please wait. I will never fly with this airline again. The cancel theirs flights up and down how they want it without reason.

Mike,"May 19, 2020",Royal Air Maroc,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,I was due to fly with Royal Air Maroc in March 2020 and paid Euros 552 for the flight. RAM cancelled the flight and have refused to refund a single euro. I have emailed them several times and their customer service is amongst the worst I’ve ever experienced. I also emailed their CEO and got zero response which shows how interested he must be in maintaining his customer base. They have offered a voucher in lieu of a refund which I will not be accepting. I have previously flown with RAM and have found their staff to be racist. I wholeheartedly agree with some of the other reviews on here and would recommend that you avoid using this airline. By way of comparison around the same time that my flight was cancelled with RAM I also had a flight with Easyjet cancelled. Within a few short weeks Easyjet refunded the full amount without any questions. RAM have an awful lot to learn.
Mare,"August 17, 2019",Royal Air Maroc,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I experienced a flight technical problems with a very poor communication from the flight attendance( flight AT 770). After 3 hours of delay, they finally told us the flight is unable to travel. it was on July 28, 2019 at Roissy Airport( France) . A lady from the flight attendance hurried us to get out from the plane before she turnes off the light. They brought passengers at the hotel late in th night , so they will not have to pay our dinner. The next day, we were fightingt to get our right to flight because most of us bought in advance their ticket  months ago. They called the Police on us , but we explained calmely that we were not violent. We are only asking them to put us in alternative flight to Dakar. Finally, they provided us with another plane around 7:00 PM. During my return on August 13, I lost my two bags. I made a claim through ALYZIA , but When you call the call center with the number they gave you, you will be  waiting for more than 30 MN before being notified that the system is unable to take your call."

Vicki,"November 13, 2018",Royal Air Maroc,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,4,4,2,4,,,4,No,"I flew two legs of an open jaw ticket to Europe with Royal Air Maroc (Marrakech-Casablanca and Casablanca to Dohar) on 1 Nov 2018, with the majority of my flights being on Qatar. RAM is a Qatar program partner, and the airline combination produced a great price on Skyscanner. Well, folks, you get what you pay for – and I didn’t read the reviews of RAM prior to booking. Flight AT402 from Marrakech to Casablanca was fine. At only 50 minutes, the plane went up, flew at cruising altitude for about 15 minutes, then landed. All fine there, apart from having to walk across the tarmac and up a flight of steps to board. Same deal landing in Casablanca in reverse. Then the nightmare started. Separating of passengers connecting to international flights and those terminating in Casablanca was done outside the rear entry doors to the arrivals terminal. Passengers were jammed up against the side of the building standing in puddles of water (as it had been raining) waiting to have their passport and ticket examined by one of two officials who told them to go through either the international connections door or the domestic arrivals door. It actually started to rain lightly while I was waiting which wasn’t much fun. Then another bus of disembarking passengers pulled up and there was no room for them to get off the bus and stand safely out of danger from passing airport vehicles. It was slow-moving mayhem, and I’d imagine that people with tight connections missed their flights. I had a 3-hour layover, so once inside the arrivals terminal, I settled down and waited for AT216 to Doha. Luckily I checked the departure gate several times as it was changed without notice or announcement shortly before boarding opened (from Level 1 to the ground level). Again we had to walk across the tarmac and climb stairs to board. Everything seemed fine as we taxied down the runway… then sat for about 20 minutes. Eventually an announcement was made that we were going back to the terminal, and we taxied back. A hoist/lift was wheeled out to the right-hand wing and several mechanics peered at a central flap which was elevated (the other flaps were all lying flush with the edge of the wing), and made calls on their mobile phones. So we sat… and sat… and sat… for 3 hours 45 minutes! No announcements were made, no refreshments were given, nothing! Eventually I went to the galley to get some water and asked one of the male flight attendants what was happening, and was told there was a “technical services” problem, but that we should be leaving within 15 minutes. Well, that never happened. By that stage, people were getting tired and irritable. The two very small children in front of me were going beserk, screaming, jumping up and down, crying, running up and down the aisles, etc – understandable, as they were bored witless (as were we all). Luckily it wasn’t a hot day as the plane’s air conditioning wasn’t running, but it got really stuffy and uncomfortable. People started sleeping across three seats if they had a row to themselves. Eventually we were told to prepare for takeoff. The flight attendants who had been sitting in the galley for most of the previous 3 hours 45 minutes appeared and made a cursory check of the cabin. The man behind me was still sleeping across three seats as we started taxiing down the runway, not strapped in or anything! I was about to draw the attention of one of the bored flight attendants to this when he spotted him, shook him awake and told him to sit up and buckle up. No safety briefing was given as we were just about to take off.- unbelievable! As we took off, I had a clear view out the window of the wing – and the flap WHICH WAS STILL ELEVATED! Nothing had changed. I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best, reassured somewhat that several people had been taking photos with their mobile phones which I thought would at least be found if we crashed. So it was a nerve wracking 6-hour flight to Doha. We made up about 45 minutes in the air, but I still had to run through Doha airport to make my QR900 connection to Perth as boarding had commenced at the same time as the RAM flight landed. I would never fly RAM again. They’re disorganised, don’t apparently maintain their aircraft adequately and pay scant regard to safety. I felt less than confident on a 6-hour flight with them as the “technical services” issue did not appear to have been rectified. In addition, we were not kept informed as to what the problem with the aircraft was, nor given refreshments on board while we waited for the problem to be fixed. On the plus side, however, my luggage magically appeared at Perth airport, despite the extremely short connection time in Doha. However, I suspect that was Qatar’s efficient service, not RAM’s."
Samantha,"September 4, 2018",Royal Air Maroc,3.4,Flew Economy Class,7.0,5,4,4,3,,,4,Yes,"I had read a lot of bad reviews about Royal Air Maroc so I was pleasantly surprised! The flight was fine, the food was good, there was entertainment available if you had a device to link to their wifi and all of my luggage made it! The security check at Casablanca was tense and chaotic but that is not the airlines fault. Definitely recommended!"
Chris,"August 30, 2019",Royal Brunei,7.7,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,Yes,"I recently flew Royal Brunei from Melbourne to Jakarta via Brunei.

Stephen,"December 5, 2016",Royal Brunei,7.7,Flew Economy,8.0,5,5,5,3,,,4,Yes,"We flew Melbourne to London return – with RB the deal is more complicated than with some other airlines: First the flight experience is excellent for economy – the 787 is a great plane  – legroom is terrific for economy, a 4 course meal is served each leg of quite good quality and the customer service level on all flights was good. IFE is OK – take your own head phones – the supplied ones are rubbish. Second – the price is very low compared to other airlines. Third – the flight configuration is 3 hops of 7 – 8 hours. Having flown this route more times than I can remember I really like this configuration compared to two longer flights but its personal choice. Fourth – RB has no back up plan – when things go wrong expect long delays. We spent an extra night in Brunei due to a maintenannce issue with one plane, but we met people who had been delayed several days. RB put us up in a very basic 3 star hotel and poor quality meals were supplied during the delay. Would I fly them again – maybe – the cheap price and high comfort level is attractive enough to consider but you need to have flexible plans – if you need to hit a fixed date pay the extra for a bigger airline."
John,"December 2, 2016",Royal Brunei,7.7,Flew Business,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"Used RB for our trip from Mel to LHR last year, could not faulty any aspect, OK the IFE was limited but the cost of the flight  more than made up for it.

The Lady on the counter (R.M) and her manager walked to the room behind the counter acting that they were trying to solve my problem, but it seemed like it’s a well-rehearsed drama. I called RJ call center I was told that it’s a full flight and they will not be able to provide me an alternative flight until 27th of Dec (Boxing day). Soon after the manager and her employee (R.M) walked out from the back room trying to apologies for the situation. and They rejected to provide me a hotel even nor a flight for the following day.

Tom,"January 7, 2020",Royal Jordanian,5.3,Flew Business Class,2.0,2,3,2,2,1,3,3,No,"5 months ago, Royal Jordanian “lost” my luggage for 2 months, basically ignoring (or refusing to respond to) ALL my communications to them until eventually “discovering” my bag sitting somewhere in one of their outstations.  Once it was returned (to the front porch of my house while I was out on another trip for 2 weeks), they generally refused any compensation at all.  After finally finding enough RJ email addresses and badgering them they finally agreed to a partial compensation of my 1st day’s emergency expenses, finally upping that offer to all my 1st day’s expenses.  They’re refusing any compensation for everything I had to replace during the remaining 2 months before they finally “discovered” and returned my bag. I have filed a complaint thru US DOT Traveler’s Protection and no surprise, Royal Jordanian is even ignoring them now."

I missed my flight and I had the right to choose next flight but it seems the Royal Jordanian Airlines doesn’t care of customers and just trying to abuse the stucked passengers and make money by  tricking customers! They asked me to pay minimun 2X of my original ticket price for rescheduling + $150 as rescheduling fee for  my substitue flight while the other first class airlines offer flights cheaper than my original ticket price with Royal Jordanian in the same specific time! It means I lost my money with Royal Jordanian Airlines and I got stocked with my trip. I highly recomend if you want peace of mind, do not  use the Royal Jordanian Airlines. Instead you can use other airlines with good customer service and good reputation. I never use this airline anymore in my life based on my own experience and others experience with this airline."

My 1st Class ticket was purchased through American Airlines as a OneWorld codeshare.  American confirmed scanning the bag delivered to RJ264 before departure.  After waiting at AMM baggage claim for the 1st 45 minutes after arrival, a baggage clerk confirmed that it was still processing through security.  At 1 ½ hour after arrival, the same baggage clerk said that now he could no longer find it back there.  How could my bag have “disappeared” while processing through security? After filing my lost luggage claim at the AMM airport, I have had had NO RESPONSE and NO CONTACT from Royal Jordanian airlines.  I have called every phone number listed for customer service and they are all just looped recordings that keep transferring to another message.  In the last 6 weeks I have sent more than 12 emails to your Royal Jordanian Head Office that have not been answered.  Are you just assuming that if you ignore me long enough I will go away?

ahmad,"December 24, 2018",Royal Jordanian,5.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,2,No,"this company stole my money… i flew from montreal to dubai with my 11 month old daughter and my pregnant wife who was under 28 weeks pregnant, so we didnt need any certificate for her to fly. We specifically asked them at the check in counter in Montreal if we need to get one from Dubai when we come back home 2 and half weeks later and they told us no WE DONT, so we didnt bother getting one from a gynecologist in Dubai. On the way back from Dubai, its 4 am Dubai time, and the company is not allowing us to fly with them, since my wife if passed the 28 weeks pregnant even though they told us in Montreal we dont need one. we tried explaing that to them but they were soo studborn and didnt really care and had zero sympathy that we had a baby and a pregnant wife and its 5 am at this time and where we had no where to go. They did not accomodate us with anything, and MADE US PAY A PENALTY OF 1810$ CAN, to change the booking to the next flight which was only 4 days later. So we got stuck in dubai 4 extra days, missed work, and had to find a last min hotel, taxi, with 6 luggages, stroller, and 3 handbags.They put me on the spot and in a way forced me to pay the penalty because that was the only way to change the booking. all that other than the fact that they lost my stroller in amman jordan during my lay over of 6 hours, but finally found it 2 hours later, so i had a very hard time with my baby without a stroller or the car seat, that i never saw until i arrived to Dubai, even thow i specifically aske3d for it. the airlines is always late, never on time. bad service. Whenever you ask someone for help, they keep thowing it to the next person, no one wants to take this blame for anything, no one is willing to help. so in the end, i get the wrong information from them, and i pay the price for it. NEVER FLYINMG WITH THEM AGAIN, NOR SHOULD YOU. Thats why on google its raited THE 2ND WORST AIRLINES IN THE WORLD."
Ahmad,"December 21, 2018",Royal Jordanian,5.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Worst service, worst airline to travel with. I flew from montreal to dubai with a 11 month old baby and a pregnant wife. They told us at the check in counter in montreal that we can fly without the need of a certificate to fly for my wife since she is pregnant and under 28 weeks. And we specifically asked them if we need to get one when we come back 2 and half weeks later since she will have passed the 28 weeks by a few days, and they told us NO. so on the way back from dubai, at the check in counter, they asked us about the pregnancy and we were very honest with them and told them that she just passed her 28 weeks. So they obviously did not allow is to fly without the certificate. And we tried explaing to them in dubai that we were told in montreal that we didnt need it but they didnt care. So they threw us out at 5 am dubai time. With a baby and a pregnant wife. And made us pay 1800$ penalty to change the booking to the nxt flight 4 days later. All that because we received the wrong info from them in montreal. Worst ailine ever. Otheer than the part that they are never on time. Always late. Plus lost my stroller for my baby. But finally found it 2 hours later but missing the cup holder. Worst service."

Rowan,"July 18, 2023",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,No,"Avoid flying with Ryanair. They have unreasonable policies and impose excessive fines if you don’t follow them to the letter. You can’t bring a small hand luggage (only a backpack). You need to pay ‘priority’ (a deceptive misnomer) to bring a small hand luggage. I had a backpack, but on my way back they claimed that it was bigger than what was allowed. I did put it in their box, but they claimed it didn’t quite fit. They charged me £80 for a backpack. They refused to accept cash and refused to accept apple pay. Although I was willing to pay, they didn’t help me and were ready to prevent me from boarding. I gave them my credit card and they claimed that it wasn’t accepted. I had to log into my bank account to show them that they took the money. They let me board seconds before the gate was closed. I asked for a receipt. They would email it to me. They didn’t."
Boris,"April 24, 2023",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,3.0,2,3,2,0,2,1,0,Yes,"I had to pay for ski equipment at check-in in airport even though I paid when booking the tickets. Unlike all others companies,  they require payment for each bag of ski equipment separately: bag with ski and bag with boots. On the back flight  they didn’t require an additional payment – it means 2 bags of ski equip were okey?!  Despite a month of correspondence, they do not want to return the funds. Apart from this, the flight was reasonable even though the staff is frustrated and the price is quite high"
Ruby,"April 11, 2023",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,1,0,No,"Ryanair is a disgusting company that cancels flights with no warning, does not offer alternative travel plans nor any form of compensation. I made the mistake of choosing to travel with ryanair and had my flight cancelled 2 hours before departure, they told me they did not have any other available flights for a week which is clearly unacceptable. They then assured me that if I made my own alternate travel plans I would be reimbursed so I did this and after three months of multiple phone calls and claim forms they denied my claim to any compensation or covering my travel expenses because the cancellation was due to weather (there was no storm that day and other airlines were flying to the same destination). I am disgusted with their customer service and urge everyone to know that their cheap fares are not worth the risk."

Edward,"September 8, 2022",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,0,,1,0,No,"I flew internationally and tried to check in online the night before and the site timed out. I got to the airport 1hr 55min before the flight and tried again but was locked out of online check-in. I wasn’t checking luggage. I just needed a boarding pass and was charged £55 to print a boarding pass. I attempted several times to do this myself but was unable. Ryanair refused to refund the fee indicating I should have contacted customer service when the site timed out. As for the morning of, they don’t allow online check-in inside 2 hours."
Seb,"June 21, 2022",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,3,1,2,1,0,No,"I had a flight yesterday with Ryanair. Delayed 5 hours, no explanation, no employees to get information, no update on their website, no offer for drinks or food. Then, when asking compensation on their ‘passengers and rights’ formular, refusal because I could fly (contrary to EU directive). Total shame and I will never fly again with them. We are not customers, only products"
Mario,"January 6, 2022",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,6.0,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,Yes,A surprisingly pleasant experience with a budget airline
Lola,"October 3, 2021",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,2,0,0,4,2,0,No,"Incredibly rude flight attendant— I was YELLED at to make my 1 year old daughter sit facing forward while we were still at the gate. She was an older female on a who made all the announcements. Anyone who has a child knows how fidgety they are. All she had to do was calmly say “ma’am….”. Instead, she yelled so the whole plane can hear and said my child will be flung all the way to the front of the plane. Never in my life have I been spoken to in such a manner, especially from a flight attendant. They are usually helpful and pleasant. Will NEVER be flying with this airline again."

Clay,"June 12, 2021",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,No,"A dismal experience in every respect. Dishonest business model, built on hidden fees. Basically half airline, half scam. App is finicky – flight sales, for example, advertise nonexistent fares. It’ll show a rock-bottom price but then say the flight doesn’t exist. I also had a problem checking in this morning and it cost me €55, more than the cost of the ticket. I guess that’s how they make their money."
Rogier,"November 12, 2020",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,3,3,4,4,3,Yes,For the price paid it is an excellent option.

Yousif,"January 6, 2020",Ryanair,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"The worst experience ever with an airline. They send an Email only 2 days before the flight asking for online check-in. I couldn’t do it due to website not working at the time properly and I failed to do so. I had to go to airport more than 2 hours before the flight to ensure I still have time. They refused to help me and charged me 156 euros and said “Pay it or you won’t board” because I had to check-in at the airport, despite the issues I had that I explained to them. Later I contacted RyanAir and they said “We know you’re not happy, but we won’t help”. Customer service sound like wild animals behind the phone who just want to steal whatever money they can get from the customers."
Paul,"October 12, 2015",Sa Express,6.0,Flew Economy,4.0,3,3,2,0,,,0,No,"cheap and fairly cheerful flights within south africa but only when working planes are available, not uncommon for insufficient working craft to be available and then SA’express’s bargain basement attitude to everything is crudely exposed"

Andy,"December 7, 2016",Safi Airways,8.0,Flew Economy,8.0,5,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"I went with Safi several times between Dubai, Kabul and Islamabad, and found it one of the most reliable airlines in the region. Though low-budget, the airline seems fairly decent and safe. Cabin crew is helpful and polite, food tastes like in any Afghan restaurant. Price and quality seem very well balanced. Only downside: the online booking system doesnt seem to work since several months now, hope they will fix it soon."
Nancy,"August 9, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew First Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,4,No,Good luck with finding a lost luggage. We flew first class to Oslo from Paris and have been missing our bag for 3 days!!! Very limited office hours and terrible customer service. Fly Norwegian Airlines!
Loreta,"June 26, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,No,"Bad service, no respect, poor communication, last minute cancelation, extra pay seats change, not edible breakfast, late baggage delivery to carousel, no assistance with short connection, no even apology for inconvenience and so on…I will not remember how much money I spent on a ticket, but  I will definetly remember the bad expierence for a long time.  I will remember “don’t travel with SAS”. There’s no possibility to file a complain. SAS website provide you with the form “flight expierence” but after filling the form no possibility to submit it… SAS can’t blame covid or low budget ,  sadly the biggest problem they have – their attitude about the business they run."
Lexi,"June 12, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,Absolutely horrible experience. Flight was delayed with no information on when it would be rescheduled. Finally got that info and arrived at the gate only to find no one there and that it was delayed yet again with no information. Flight attendants are rude and rarely come around for service. Would NEVER fly with them again and I strongly suggest others avoid at all costs unless you want to pay exorbitant fees with no service whatsoever.
Dana,"June 12, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,1,3,1,1,1,4,No,"I paid for 2 carry-ons (for my wife and me) round trip LAX/CPH/LAX. On the return trip a rude ticket counter agent demanded we put our bags on the scale, and they were slightly over limit, so we had to check them and pay the huge, inflated charges. Upon return home I asked to be refunded for the carry-on charges we prepaid, but they refused.   Then I read all the negative reviews of this airline, and then it all made sense. Taking aim at any opportunity to enhance their revenue.  Treating their source of revenue (customers) badly."
Anatoly,"June 12, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,1,4,1,1,,1,No,"Flight from LHR to Oslo — technically international. Must pay for water! Only “tea” and “coffee” is free. Plane: old Airbus 320. Seat design and construction are inspired by Spanish Inquisition. Zero amenities – like seat head rest, disinfecting wipes, blankets or pillows. Well, blankets weren’t necessary: the cabin is poorly ventilated and quite warm. On the connecting flight from Oslo to Tromso, my rolling board was confiscated due to the wait limitation. Subsequently it was delayed until the next day, despite assurances that it will be on the later flight the same day. The next morning, there was no sign from the SAS delayed luggage service, so I had to drive to the airport to pick up my luggage.  Personally, one of my bleakest experiences in air travel. Avoid if you can."
Sharon,"May 23, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,3,1,4,1,2,3,No,"Absolutely terrible customer “service.”  My friend and I were double charged for luggage, and when we showed it to the person at the ticket counter, she said she couldn’t refund it, we’d have to submit a claim.  It took them over a month to respond and then they refused to even look at the screenshots we had showing we should not have been charged the second time.  Then when I tried to ask a question, they stopped responding.  This was my first experience with SAS and the flights were fine, but I will certainly never go back if they’re just going to inexplicably steal my money and then ignore me when I ask why."
Raymond,"April 1, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,No,"Terrible experience with this airline. Bad in flight service, rude flight attendants, and hidden costs. Be wary of luggage costs at the airport."
Marlin,"March 4, 2023",Sas,4.0,Flew Business Class,1.0,3,2,0,3,1,2,2,No,"When we arrived in Paris, our luggage was not there. We checked the GEO tag on our bag and saw that it never left SFO. The lost or delayed baggage counter told us they’d get our luggage and deliver it to us while we were in Paris in 24 hours. We gave them the name of our hotel and their phone number. We let them know that we do not have an international number and that they should contact our hotel with any updates."
Gerald,"November 10, 2022",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"SAS flight number SK503 originating in Copenhagen at 12:35pm on 2 July 2022 flying to Heathrow for transfer to a flight to Houston.  Flight left late as pilots debated whether to go on strike.   Unfortunately, we did not document when the flight left but it was at least 3 hours later than scheduled.  We arrived in Heathrow well after connecting flight had left for Houston.  Heathrow was a disaster in that there was only one SAS person to make arrangements for many customers.  We were told that SAS would compensate us for night spent in Heathrow.   So, we took a taxi to a Holiday Inn that gouged us $1,000 for an average room and had to pay for dinner, breakfast and taxi back to airport.  SAS refused to provide any compensation as they hid behind an EU regulation that supposedly says SAS does not have to provide compensation for any delay less than 3 hours.   Lessons learned: SAS employees lie, Holiday Inn gouges, get everything in writing along with names of people involved."
Marcus,"September 23, 2020",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,2,4,3,2,No,SAS has stopped refunding canceled flights. I would recommend to choose another airline if you don’t want to loose money and experience terrible customer service. Been a loyal customer for 25 years.
John,"August 28, 2020",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,1,0,No,"Waiting 4 months for a refund is not acceptable. Wideroe cancelled a flight and refunded in 2 weeks. Easyjet, the same. To think it is acceptable to cancel flights and keep hold of customers money and only offer vouchers is a disgrace."
Per,"January 8, 2020",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,"Professional airline. Did cut down on lounge access and fast track for third party services. However, if something goes wrong, it’s good to have a solid support framework. SAS does have that."
URBAN,"December 24, 2019",Sas,4.0,Flew Business Class,8.0,4,4,4,2,3,5,3,Yes,"I am a Diamond member and travel about 80 times a year, mostly domestic in Scandinavia but about 4 times abroad in different european countries. The crew, service, safety, information and compensation for late timetabel/cancellation are usually very good and the extra with better food, fresh/new airplane and lounge are more standard. A factor to chose SAS has been generous (double the value if choosing a voucher) compensation because of delayed bagage or plane, eurobonusmembership and the sasapp, easy, functionally and always working. New planes are introducing now and it will be better comfort and less carbon footprint."
Fleming,"December 6, 2019",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,4,5,4,4,5,4,Yes,"Good long haul flight. Nothing special. Nice cabin, good food and great crew! (only the limited free beverage service was poor)"
Christiane,"September 4, 2019",Sas,4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Worst airline experience EVER. Gave away my seat while I was stuck at immigration in Copenhagen – made me run back and forth to the gate to get it fixed. Paid extra for the premium meal, it was disgusting – greasy and inedible chicken.  Had to pay $106 for an additional bag.  Tried to get upgraded to Premium Economy and you have to BID for one of the seats.  Yes, BID.   Then, they don’t tell you until 36 hours before the flight if you win the seat.  Horrible customer service, terse and unhelpful crew, expensive and crap food.  I’ve traveled all over the world on many airlines and this is the absolute worst.  Never again."
Joao,"January 10, 2017",Sata Air Acores,4.4,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,2,0,,,1,No,"There is absolutely no explanation for why people flight SATA, there are no entertainment on board, not even the old ones, they do have the screens in every chair, however there is no actual program running on them."
Lyle,"October 8, 2015",Sata Air Acores,4.4,Flew Economy,8.0,3,3,4,3,,,3,Yes,Toronto to the Azors return in March 2015 Terrific value package included flights transfers accomodation and breakfast. No issues with baggage limits due to ticket class inc. with package. Flight was on time both ways and no more or less comfortable than any other economy flight. Took a sleeping pill both ways and they left me alone. i got about what I expected and am flying with them to the Canaries in November. About on par with air cubana or air panama.
Fábio,"August 29, 2015",Sata Air Acores,4.4,Flew Economy,9.0,4,5,4,1,,,5,Yes,"The flight was good and the cabin crew was very good,the food on board was good, too."
Bob,"April 3, 2015",Sata Air Acores,4.4,Flew Economy,3.0,3,2,1,1,,,2,No,"Customer service is terrible.  Before the flight, they left busload of passengers sitting on tarmac for many minutes while staff tried to figure out if plane was ready (why did they fill the bus if plane not ready?).  Old fashioned “entertainment” with one or two tiny TV screens several seats away showing one outdated movie.  Food barely passable, and breakfast very poor.  Very cramped seating.  Captain never said “boo” the whole time, and cabin crew were surly.  No one even smiles.  Very few checkin agents so it takes a long time.  Again, not thought about the customer.  These people simply do not understand customer comfort or service."
Yuri,"July 9, 2014",Sata Air Acores,4.4,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"My negative experience with this company was mainly with customer service and their “light” package. I can’t understand why a company would sell tickets that include no baggage on a transatlantic flight. Later when I tried to understand and figure out how I can bring my baggage I felt like I was being treated very disrespectfully by the agent who told me that I had purchased “the cheapest ticket.” I didn’t even understand what they were talking about at first. This structure seems unfair and confusing to me. Later when I tried to upgrade the pricing structure was totally absurd with ridiculous fees. $200 for an extra luggage. I have never heard of such prices. I’ve been told by other companies $70 at most on additional luggage. In any case, the hassle of figuring out how this company works and the extra fees they will charge you if you purchase the wrong product are not worth the hassle. Go with another company…"

I decided to fly from Medellin’s Enrique Olaya Airport as I can save some time and few pesos as it was located inside the Medellin city compared to the Jose Maria Cordova INTL airport which is located far from Medellin city. Only Satena airlines offer flights between EOH and BOG route. Heard that this airline has frequent cancellations and delays. Check in was smooth but as per reviews my flight which has actual departure on a 12.32pm was also cancelled and I was later accommodated on 3.00pm flight, so my purpose of saving time in the commute to airport was ruined. My flight was operated with an ATR42 aircraft, it was very old and the aircraft’s cabin was dirty. However if there was no cancellations, I would definitely fly with them again."
Melanie,"January 19, 2018",Satena,4.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I don’t recommend using this airline. We had to be at midday in Providencia Island and Satena cancelled our flight.

On our way back the pilot went to us after we check in our lagguage and told us that he alerdy worked 12 hrs so we will have to wait for tommorow to fly back to medllin. Becouse of that we lost our flight to Bogota-Letisia that we booked to the folowing day… When we ask Satena in Medllin to give us a new ticket to Bogota – letisia they kept us waiting 5 hrs with different excuses. In the end we gave up. We will never fly again with Satena!!! There are atleat 5 other companys in Colombia that do local flight… Fly with other company!

Missed my connecting flight on Avianca..The next Avianca flight to Cucuta was full, and I didn’t want to fly standby. So I booked with Satena. Flew on a 40 seat Turbo prop. Not bad, fairly comfortable short flight. They offered snacks and sodas on board. The plane was clean, even the head was clean. The counter service at BOG was good and counter staff were polite. The on-board service was decent. The flight.left BOG on time, arrived at CUC on time. No baggage issues, but I only had one small checked bag.

Because laggages wasnt coming at all in baggage claim area. We also lost our baby stroller laggage and 2 zamzam water packages after 40 minutes. Because of this delays we missed our 8.25 am BA132 flight to London in North terminal. This caused us soo much stress and pain to my 6 month pregnant wife and 16 month old baby son. This also caused us many expenses going forward and backwards between terminals and finally booking a hotel at Jeddah for one night and rebooking a flight to London tomorrow afternoon.

On this latest occasion, the flight departed Jeddah late, the delay was never announced on the airport screens and as usual the Saudia personnel knew nothing. Once the flight arrived in Riyadh, the passengers were sent to a carousel to “pick up their luggage.” No one mentioned to the passengers that the plane had left Jeddah without 95% of our baggage. There were no Saudia reps at the carousel and the passengers, including myself, were left waiting 1 and 1/2 hours for our baggage.  Needless to say the baggage never arrived.    We were given a claim number and told we would receive a text when our bags came in and that we would have to return to the airport for them, no such thing as sending the bags to you.."
Rakesh,"February 2, 2019",Saudia,3.4,Flew Business Class,2.0,2,3,4,4,,,2,No,Useless Lounge in Jeddha – airport staff arrogant and not consumer friendly. Food in the lounge was useless – no choice.
Bert,"July 27, 2018",Saudia,3.4,Flew Economy Class,8.0,4,4,4,3,,,3,Yes,"Living as an expat in Saudi Arabia I fly Saudia quite frequently. Overall, the planes are usually clean and well kept, the legroom is acceptable (better than e.g. KLM or Air France), staff is commonly friendly and entertainment offering is sufficient (not as good as Emirates obviously). The food is good enough, but 99 out of 100 the same, chicken with rice…. A plus is that Saudia is typically on time, both in departure as arrival. Travelers on board are frequently hilarious, especially Saudi’s who believe they can get home before you by jumping up from their seats while still on the runway, grabbing their carry-on and pushing forward. Staff tries to get everyone seated again, but quickly gives up (I can understand). Saudi parents travelling with children (on long haul) do not manage their children very closely, or leave it to their domestic help, so sometimes that can be a bit of a drawback. In summary, I find it a pleasant airline."
igor,"January 3, 2018",Saudia,3.4,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,2,3,1,,,1,No,"Hi, firstly I would like to express my strong dissatisfaction and disappointment with Saudia’s service STARTING IN MADRID AIRPORT WHERE I HAD TO PAY 135EUROS FOR MY SURFBOARDS THAT didn’t arrive with me at my final destination. Unfortunately it wasn’t well specified in the main luggage page, only if you do a good search on the website. Unlucky I guess. A couple hours later I found out my flight was delayed, with no help or information from the stressed out team members at the airport. As this wasn’t enough when I got to my final destination my luggage and my surfboards were nowhere to be seen. (I wasn’t very surprised to be honest) At the airport I was told that my stuff should be delivered to me in a maximum of 2 days and I was handled 75$ so I could buy some basic stuff as the only thing I had were the cloths I was wearing. 2 days after my arrival I received a call from Saudia saying that the next flight that would bring my luggage would only be in 5 days! That would let me 7 days, a whole week of my holidays with absolutely nothing. Spending 20 euros a day with surfboards rental, when I had to pay 135 to travel with my own. After sending an massive complaint email I received a call from them saying that my luggage would be delivered in the next morning, less the 12 hours. So they were lying to me. There was a paper on my bag saying that my bag was sent to my final destination one day after my flight, but someone crossed with a pen and wrote the date I was informed by the company. So even with all the nightmare that it was flying with Saudia, they still lied to me, trying to leave me a whole week without anything, just to save some pennies. After all I asked a man called Lakmali Ranasinghe for a refund of the extra luggage I had to pay for my surfboards, I was told that the concerned department would call me to assist me with my claim. Surprise! I never got the call An absolutely disgrace, never flying with Saudia again! Ps. They also manage to break the nose of my surfboard."

Old plane with hard seats and no cushion.Arm rest broken and patched with sellotape. One poor quality, complimentary meal and drink and after that everything had to be paid for, even drinking water. No inflight entertainment. This was an 8 hour flight!! Arrived at Changi feeling tired and uncomfortable, with another 14 hour flight ahead of me.Would not have booked if I’d known."

The seats are just fine, and the legroom is better than on most budget airlines. Definitely my airline of choice in SE Asia."

If we go out, we’ll be quarantined for 14 days. shock 8: The Scoot manager is kidding us: We need a medical certificate, we would get it in a clinic nearby. But this clinic doesn’t test anyone – and the manager should know it. shock 9: No flight money back! The manager was generous enough to give us the flight to Bangkok (instead of Athens).

Georgia,"January 18, 2020",Scoot,3.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,I had the most abysmal experience with Scoot at every interaction including before the flight (cancelled 1 day before and no other flights available except their partner company Singapore airlines which was $500AUD more). On the flight there is no water available for free (12 hour flight) until I complained and stated it is actually illegal and the airline host told me to be quiet and game me a small bottle. And after the flight (still going on and it has been over 6 months…) I have been emailing Scoot customer service and they have refused to provide a complaints avenue so I have succumbed to my first ever online review because of the level of disappointment and fury I have with Scoot.

The flight attendant wouldn’t accept coins. I had a US$100 note, so tried that. She said $100 was too big a note. I tried my Visa cards, but they wouldn’t accept debit cards."

The flight was full and cramped. The breakfast meal service was the worst food I have had on an airliner in a long time. Meal service is the standard haphazard level of the parent company China Eastern with the croissant arriving a long time after the meal. Incidentally the croissant was the only edible part of the meal. Coffee comes with milk and sugar already added so if you prefer coffee black without sugar, tough!! I would not fly with this airline again!"

Toilets always kept clean although the pilot seemed a little over anxious on switching on the seat belt sign every little bump which can delay meal service and toilet stops! All flights were on A330-200 even domestic!!! Nice touch is end of flight exercises which were on inter and domestic flights. Only complaint was all 3 breakfasts where we had no choice ( 2 flights ) consisted of a totally tastless rice slop. You are provided a bag of spicy pickles to enhance but even they didn’t work, Sack the breakfast chef!!! I am rating airline overall across 3 flights"

A very short, entertaining 1 hour Sunday evening Yichang to Chongqing internal Airbus A320 flight. The thoughtful check in staff ensured that the middle seat in the row was kept free for my colleague and I (the only two foreigners on the flight). In-flight entertainment was some American “candid camera” type show played on the drop-down flat screens that kept the local pax thoroughly entertained and amused. The snack was a bottle of water and small plastic tube sample of 4 chili-rated Chongqing Hotpot; very interesting and a bit messy (napkins were provided) that definitely required the water! Not sure how I would rate their long haul flights, but I give this one 6/10."

Service was excellent, meals tasty (as they were the last trip), staff are friendly and happy to help pax.  The B738 was a new plane and still had that new plane feel and smell. Seating is standard, but comfortable enough for a short haul flight.  IFE is limited to the MI app so using your own tablet or app is probably the way to go.  Local English language newspapers were offered."

He is good. Bravo.The cabin crew on my return trip Bdo to Sin on 24 Nov 16 at 1000hrs were all smiles and friendlier than my Sin to Bdo (maybe becuz the earlier crew were stressed with the many special meal requests and had less than 90mins to get them done) but they were still okay.  Overall it was a pleasant experience which I have every intention of repeating. Will highly recommend Silkair to my acquaintances. See you soon – hopefully I get Capt Sureish again on my short haul flight. A big THANK YOU from me to the Silkair team.

But I appreciated much thought SILK air put into to arrange out settings such a way that we can keep our baby with us in the middle seat in single row. We were so happy that day because of that. Our baby slept through-out the journey. I loved that moments for helping us travel in one row side by side even though I had booked tickets in different rows.

We are all in our 70’s and booked a week at a sandals for over $6000. After checking in and getting a boarding pass with a seat assignment they informed us they downsized the plane and three of the four couples were not allowed to board. It took six hours to get any information on a possible flight the next day. We were told to call there reservation number to see if they were able to get a larger plane for the next day as the scheduled plane was already full. We attempted to call their reservations and were on hold for over an hour until our call was disconnected at 9PM when it closed. We flew from California for this trip and now will be returning without getting to the Bahamas and we are out $6000! And what did Silver airlines offer us….

No options for another flight were given although there was another small plane getting ready to fly to San Juan. Again – I was lucky to get on a ferry and a taxi – and that of course cost me extra almost exactly what I paid for my plane tickets.

They do not respond to emails either.  This is the most frustrating experience ever.  I would not fly with them if I didn’t have to with the route I take.  Most flights are cancelled or delayed….horrible, I repeat horrible, customer service and what really boils my blood is when you call them and they say they have been voted one of the top ten airlines for customer service by Conde Nast magazine……what a crock of &$%#*.

Leslie,"September 10, 2018",Silver Airways,1.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,4,0,,,0,No,We flew Silver Airways to and from Ft. Lauderdale to Marsh Harbor . My story is this: not only was our ticketing agent slow but she was angry and Mean Spirited . We waited for ten minutes before she could find Us in her system and then she claimed that We didn’t prepay for our baggage ( which we did ) so after another five minutes she found that We had paid . Then it took her another five minutes to print out the baggage tickets and while we were waiting another agent had to help her figure out how the printer worked . Then She seemed confused as to which bag to tag as she had moved it over to the luggage belt .So I pointed out my bag and she turned around with a snear on her face and said I know . We moved on to the TSA check point where I was Selected for a Pat Down and Carry On Luggage search . When I asked why they said it was ordered by Silver Airways . So why would you hire such a Vindictive and Mean Spirited Agent ? Do you not think that flying is stressful enough ? Silver Airways You need to do better !
George,"May 31, 2018",Silver Airways,1.9,Flew First Class,1.0,1,4,1,0,,,1,No,"To start with, 90 minutes to check in the 8 parties ahead of us. Then, the flight out of Marsh Harbour was 90 minutes late departing. Not a problem, as we all know Silver is the worst airline on the planet and a mere late departure is a “win” compared to a cancellation, which is fairly regular. The connecting 2:50 flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Tampa was delayed until 4:40. We went to find food. At 4:25 we arrived at the gate to learn that the flight left at 4:17. The surly gate agent said the 4:40 departure time was “an estimate”. Not the first time Silver has been a bust. Do yourself a favor and fly any other airline."
John,"April 5, 2018",Silver Airways,1.9,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,,,2,No,"My wife and I used Silver Airways to fly from a personal vacation on Key West to a business meeting in Orlando, and it may have been the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. The problems started with weather delays (I understand this is not the airline’s fault), and snowballed into much bigger problems costing me time and money. The worst part of the entire problem is that throughout the entire thing, none of their representatives seem to care! They have the perfect system set up for customer service: put the phone on a machine that instructs people with concerns to send them an email, then do not ever answer the emails! After a month of multiple attempts to contact them, I’ve received no response whatsoever. They don’t care about their customers, they don’t care about their mistakes. DO NOT EVER BOOK ON THIS AIRLINE!!!"
Adriana,"April 28, 2017",Silver Airways,1.9,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,2,1,,,1,No,"Worst airline ever!!!!!!!!!!! Their flight was 30 minutes late and I missed my next flight because of it. Then they refused to help me and blamed everything on Expedia. I ended up staying an extra night at the city where I was supposed to catch my next flight and they refused to cover my hotel expenses; their manager, Jennifer, specifically stated the following, “let her know that she is not getting any food vouchers or hotel rooms from us”. Degrading and inhumane treatment. Stay away from these thieves!!!!!!!"

Krista,"March 29, 2017",Silver Airways,1.9,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Well I was trying to check in online for over 24 hours. Then we got to the airport only TEN MINUTES LATE due to the airport shuttle running at certain times (we didn’t have a vehicle there) and they WOULD NOT let us on our plane, which hadn’t even boarded yet. We don’t even have any luggage only one small carry on bag. Our flight was at 9:45am and we got there at 9am. They also wouldn’t refund our money! I paid $1,200 for these plane tickets and they even CHARGED US $200 extra dollars to change our tickets and we weren’t even able to get on the next flight until 5 pm. I’m so upset, that ruined a whole day of our vacation. I would not recommend them to ANYONE!!!! YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
george,"May 10, 2016",Silver Airways,1.9,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,1,0,,,0,No,I fly silver airways at least twice a month from Dulles Air Port to west virginia   but recently i have frustrating experience of their boarding announcement. I guess a lady with a Spanish accent makes terrible announcement  which is hard to understand a single word  out of it and it seems no one  cares to correct that. It is horrible to seat and wait  for long  without out understand what is going on with your flight. It is  a terrible  customer service
Gary,"January 7, 2024",Singapore Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,4.0,2,2,5,3,4,,3,Yes,"I have always rated Sing Air highly, efficient, clean, and excellent service however Cairns to Singapore is a definite exception.  737 max is cramped and barely suitable for a 6-hour + Trip. A full flight with only 2 rear toilets is a huge issue, with continuous lines stretching down the cabin and the passengers at the rear half of the aircraft understandably getting agitated.  By 2 hours out the toilets were disgusting.  The seats were uncomfortable and numbing.  Very  unsatisfactory flight  not reccommended"
Lee,"November 24, 2023",Singapore Airlines,6.3,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,No,"it appears that Singapore Airlines slogan “Placing you at the heart of everything we do”, only applies when you are actually travelling, any customer service does not extend to dealing with complaints regarding delays quickly and efficiently. We were delayed 24 hours in September 2023, and we are still waiting for the airline to resolve and comply with UK civial aviation rules regarding compensation."

Melbourne to Singapore Our seats were in the front row of premium economy. There were no amenities kits but we were provided with headphones plus a blanket and a pillow which were removed by cabin staff  prior to take off and not returned. The seats in our row looked like business class seats from about thirty years ago and were completely worn out and broken. My inflight entertainment control was wedged into the arm rest and the seat did not recline. The cabin staff made me feel it was my fault the seats did not work.  All the seats in our row were faulty. Dinner was provided about 2 AM. However I already had a “numb Bum” by this time Cabin service started in the rear of the aircraft and worked their way forward. Premium Economy were served last The meal appeared to be left overs from economy. I chose the beef, it came with a bread roll that was hard and dry, the beef chewy. Desert was a brown “Paddle Pop “flavoured ice” Book the cook did not work."

And then when I asked them for any possible solutions they were extremely rude. They refused to take any responsibility and were just horrible to deal with. I even asked to speak to a supervisor and the guy simply said there is no one else to talk to. They will send an email to your spam folder, tell you that you didn’t see it and it isn’t their problem. Horrible company will never deal with them again."

John,"August 2, 2022",Singapore Airlines,6.3,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,4,0,1,4,3,4,No,Once great airline now rates 0 for customer service – changes booked flights and do not coordinate with partner airlines leaving customers stranded for days. Very hard to contact by phone.
Josh,"July 26, 2022",Singapore Airlines,6.3,Flew Business Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"3 years agio this business class product used to be a quality one. Now it is absolutely awful. Aircraft is messy, old and dirty, but that’s not even the headline of awful. It is the staff. From the minute you enter the lounge to the time you exit the flight, it is so unpleasant bordering on hostile. I have never experienced a worse business class airline experience in my life, and I can’t even imagine how bad the economy class must be!!!"

connie,"May 31, 2023",Sky Airline,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,I flew from Cusco to Lima. The staffs at the gate had me measure my carry on at their gate. My carry on was able to go through the slot but it got stuck from the handle that attached in the middle luggage. They made me pay $36 for a carry on that I already paid for!! They were so rude and mean and threaten not to let us board the flight if we don’t pay. I WILL NEVER IN MT LIFE TIME AGAIN FLY WITH THIS CHEAP AIRLINE!! They will try their best to squeeze every penny out of you anyway possible!!
Lauren,"June 17, 2020",Sky Airline,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I would avoid taking this airline. I was not able to fly because of COVID and Peru’s boarders being closed. Tje customer service is  not good and not understanding. They will only give a voucher for short time. They are a small airline, and I understand they cannot lose all profits. I also think that it is not good business to keep all the profits and not refund for a service they are not providing."
Alan,"November 8, 2019",Sky Airline,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"I booked a full fare round trip on Sky.  I had to change my flights which is allowed under their full fare rules.  The new flights for a couple of weeks later which I requested (complete with seat selection)   required additional fare,  which I immediately paid.   I then received an email stating payment was received but the new flight booking failed.  I have since requested that they either refund my total amount paid (about US$265) or give me a credit for future flights.  I have made said request four times, each time thanking me and saying they would get back to me.  I have also called and they say all such things have to be done on-line.  La-de-da.   My final take is that they have no intention of making this right and they’re pretty much stealing US$265.   So be it  but I would caution anyone about booking with Sky Airline,  as you may lose some money."

Zimu,"September 12, 2016",Sky Airline,3.3,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,0,,,0,No,"1. There are over 10 staffs and no one really speaks English. Considering it is an international airport located in the capital! 2. The staffs are not proffessional and provide wrong guidance. When we checked-in the desk was closed. The staff told us to bring the large luggage to pass the gate. Clearly, the officer refused to let us pass. Our time was wasted because of running back and forth. 3. The attitudes of staffs are rude. Since it was too late to catch the flight, we asked staffs to help us reschedule the flight. However, the attitude was rude. They were just keep telling us that we lost our ticket and asked us to repurchase the ticket. (But we already checked-in last night and stayed in the airport.) Moreover, wasting our time by arguing with us that we arrived too late. 4. The staffs were unwilling to call their manager when we requested. When they finally called their manager, all they did was discussing with each other how to avoid blame from their managers. 5. Finally, the manager came and rescheduled our flight in no time, even without asking further details. The result will be much better if the staffs were trained properly."
Martin,"January 8, 2016",Sky Airline,3.3,Flew Economy,1.0,3,3,3,0,,,3,No,"I purchased a ticket to fly Buenos Aires to Santiago, turns out the particular flight I booked was a code share with Aerolineas Argentinas.  However the ticket listed a code share as flown by TACA.  The Sky counter was closed when I arrived, TACA does not exist any more as an airline.  I was advised by an airport information attendant to go to Aerolineas, yet Aerolineas Argentinas personnel did not know they were operating a Sky code share.  Finnaly they matched me only by the flight departure time and found my booking.  Sky and Aereolineas Argentinas operate out of distant terminals, I almost missed my flight.  I was saved by a late departure by Aerolineas Argentinas, who is often late, and I had booked Sky to specifically avoid Aerolineas Argentinas."
Melissa,"August 17, 2015",Sky Airline,3.3,Flew Economy,1.0,3,3,1,3,,,3,No,"I flew with Sky Airlines to Lima, Perú from Santiago, Chile.  Before I left there was a counter attendant that checked my bag.  I asked her if I had to pick up my luggage in Lima because I had a connecting flight to Cusco. She then proceeded to tell me that I did not have to pick up my bag and transfer it to the domestic flight from Lima to Cusco. She knew I was checking a bag and she printed my tickets for both flights so she knew I had to transfer and that I would be flying another airline. I changed to Avianca from my previous flight to a Cusco domestic flight without picking up my bag as she instructed. My bag then stayed in Lima and was not transferred to any flight.  I had the Avianca personnel call as soon as I landed in Cusco and my bag did not.  They said that the Sky Airlines personnel did not pick up and that they emailed them in Cusco.  They instructed me that they would have the bag on the first flight the next morning.  The next day I called and they said that Sky had not replied to their email.  I told them that it was an emergency that I get the bag at once because my medicine and my travel companions medicine was in it.  I did not receive the bag until 3 days later"

When I finally got my luggage it was completely destroyed with my clothes burned and ragged. At baggage claim we made a damage report.

I,"August 16, 2017",Smartwings,2.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"We used Czech Airlines to fly from Helsinki to Prague and from there changing to Burgas on a SmartWings plane. It went well, no complains. But when we were supposed to fly back with SmartWings from Burgas to Prague and change for a plane to fly to London it was a disaster. In the end the flight to Prague was delayed for 8 hours (was supposed to leave at 16.30 and actually leaving at 00.15) so that we would obviously miss our flight to London on the same day (as originally we had 2 hours in between), Burgas airport staff being overly rude and not helpful (they are supposed to represent SmartWings). After not getting any help what so ever from the airport staff (we also called SmartWings customer service but they didn’t do anything either), we checked online by ourselves that the only plane leaving from Prague to London was on the next day and it would be the same flight that we would be missing that day at 19.55. This basically meant that our journey would be delayed for over 24 hours and also we wouldn’t know if there is any space on the next flight until arriving to Prague. So in the end we bought new tickets to the direct flight for the next morning and now are claiming our money"

Thay are not any worse nor better in terms of safety or comfort. What makes Smartwings especially poor experience, however, is how they undersatff check-in counters.  People need to wait lines for extremely long time because normally they only provide 1,5 person. I mean it, 1,5. My two latest experiences: There were 2 persons in the beginning, but the second one left the counter when there was “only” 50 or so people left in the queue. Next example was flight with two destinations – Boa Vista and Sal in Cabo Verde,  One counter was open exclusively for around 20 people going to Boa Vista, another counter was open for around 150 people heading for Sal.  I fly a lot but this kind of experience I only know from a few most underdeveloped places of the world. BTW, today I read Smartwings spokesperson, reaction to a negative rating of the airline indicating the small number of reviews which happened to be negative. So I am giving them one more opportunity for reflection."

Lack of possibility to check in online in advance, HUGE lines to just three counters in the Prague airport in order to check in,  landing in some backyard of the Tel Aviv airport (and having to ride to the terminal on board of the airport bus for some 20-25 minutes and, to top it off, waiting for the luggage for an hour. I understand that 330 Euro for Tel Aviv – Prague – Tel Aviv is not very expensive, but hey, I’ve used lowcosters before, and it was never THAT horrible!"

Nigel,"November 20, 2018",Solomon Airlines,7.3,Flew Economy Class,10.0,4,3,5,0,,,0,Yes,"This is a truly impressive airline. We travelled to Honaira from Brisbane and on multiple inter-island flights that were efficiently and courteously managed. When a rainstorm prevented a flight to a small grass airstrip, the company organised a special later flight when conditions cleared.

Keith,"August 22, 2013",Solomon Airlines,7.3,Flew Economy,8.0,3,4,5,3,,,4,Yes,"International service (A320, Brisbane to Honiara return) has improved considerably over last few years, with inflight meal and reasonable bar service, and now with basic IFE. Cabin staff are friendly and attentive. Likewise, reliability has been very good recently. A little bit expensive, but  cheaper than their only competitor on that route, Virgin Australia. Domestic service (last flight in DHC Twin Otter, Honiara to Fera return) remains basic – timings a bit shaky, no inflight service, but safe enough."
Tommy,"September 30, 2018",Somon Air,5.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,,,2,No,"WARNING! This is the crappiest airline among all. Pay a bit extra and fly with a more reputable and decent airline (Turkish Airlines, for instance). Somon Air treats you as garbage. I had a flight from Dushanbe to St. Petersburg with Somon Air, departure time 06:30, in the morning. I arrived at the airport more than two hours ahead, just to realise that my flight had been put off. The new departure time would be 16.5 hours later! Well, such things can happen, generally speaking. When it comes to Somon Air, these problems look more like a rule than an exception. Just a quick glance at board of departures tells the alarming truth: most flights are either cancelled or delayed. Their representatives at the airport helped me to reschedule my connecting flights at St. Petersburg. I will give them well deserved them credit. The rest of this story is far from satisfying. Usually, stranded passengers will have access to a decent hotel room, while waiting. They brought me to a rundown Intourist Hotel where I got a dormitory bed. They gave me four US-dollars cash, to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner!! The money did not even cover my breakfast!! I succeeded in getting home, one day later. However, I lost one day of income and had some extra expenditures. At home I specified my claims to the airline. They just ignored my claims, with compact silence. This airline is a complete disaster. The services on board were also of inferior quality. For your own convenience and pleasure, please pay a bit extra and get the services you can expect. You get what you pay for."

FRANCESCO,"February 28, 2020",South African Airways (Saa),4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,No,"It’s not a review of a flight but about customer care before the flight. SAA canceled my flight, bought two weeks before. Considering it was a multi-track flight (6 flights) i booked all the seats, but after the cancellation of two of these, they erased all the booking seats. I asked to proceed to re-book the seats for free, because i have already paid for them. I contacted the customer care on twitter and one operator was good and wrote me he/she rebooked all the 4 SAA flights. After 3 days the seats seems not yet booked and I’m trying again to have an answer from them on twitter, without success. I’m really disappointed because my expectation, considering they canceled my flight, is to have more customer attention about a simply request like the one of booking a seat."
David,"November 18, 2018",South African Airways (Saa),4.0,Flew Business Class,2.0,2,1,3,3,,,3,No,"I booked a business class flight from Columbus, Ohio to Durban, SA on SAA because it appeared on the reservation to be a two-stop itinerary (Washington-Johannesburg-Durban) rather than 3 stops on my preferred airline. After booking, I find that it is actually a 3 stop route, with a refueling stop in Dakar. This was not apparent in the booking process and only apparent upon checkin. To add to this, we were not allowed to get off the plane during the refueling stop and then my request for a cup of coffee was refused. The plane itself was very old, the seats uncomfortable, and shockingly for a 16 hour journey, NOT lie-flat. The power outlet did not work. I will definitely avoid SAA if possible in the future. No snacks to mention in the galley during the flight. I travelled 350,000 miles in the air last year with multiple transatlantic and transpacific flights and this was the worst."
Marek,"September 17, 2018",South African Airways (Saa),4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,2,1,,,2,No,"I have been traveling with my wife on SAA flight SA203 from Johannsburg to New York on 21 June 2018. During entire flight entertainment system was out of order which made this 15 hours journey extremally unpleasant. In addition air temperature in the cabin was very high and crew were unable to adjust it to the comfortable level. It was so hot that some of the passengers have fainted. Looks like this aircraft if very old and never was refurbished. One can often experience bad service, unpleasant situation, delay or break down during air travels. It happened to me on quite a few occasions but every time carrier involved responded to complain and at least apologised, promising improvements. Unfortunately this is not how SAA works. My complain remains unanswered for over 2 months!"
CARYN,"July 27, 2018",South African Airways (Saa),4.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"We were scheduled to fly from Tampa, USA to cape Town on March 21st. I was emailed on the afternoon of the 20th advising me of the cancellation of both our flights (Tampa-New York – Johannesburg) due to the impending storm in New York. Thankfully I noticed this email so I immediately called SAA and after 64 minutes on hold was told by an agent that the first available flight was on March 23rd. We were attending a reunion from the 23rd to 26th in Stellenbosch with accommodation prepaid, and non-refundable. This Reunion was the reason behind the travel to South Africa. I realized that if we took this flight it would get us to our destination a day late, but we had no other choice than to accept this alternative. The SAA agent then went on to tell me that because I had booked through a third party (Orbitz) and not directly with SAA I would have to contact Orbitz to make these changes. I immediately called Orbitz and waited while Sid, the Orbitz agent, was on hold with SAA customer service line for 90 minutes before actually speaking to an agent at SAA. Due to all these delays with the SAA customer phone service, or lack thereof, the original flight they had offered was full. The first available flight would be the 25th getting us to Cape Town just as the reunion was ending. Sid was then told that if we cancelled the ticket we would be given a non-transferable voucher for travel on the identical route valid for 12 months from the booking date (Jan 10th). My wife and I both work and would have to take unpaid leave to meet this requirement. As soon as we returned from South Africa on April 5th I tried calling SAA to claim our ticket refunds and/or vouchers. They were less than obliging on the phone and gave me an email address to have my ticket cancellation resolved. Or so I thought! I have attached several of my emails showing you their lack of response except for the first automatic response. To this day, nobody has bothered to reach either my wife or myself. Suffice to say we have still not had any communication and or resolve from SAA!"

We were mislead in thinking we would get first class treatment as business class is their name for first class. The seats were uncomfortable.The food was poor, that is when we actually got meals. We are both vegetarian and this was correctly entered into the SAA booking. I even checked at their desk in the Joh. airport. But on 3 of four flights we got no meals because they had no vegetarian food for us. On one flight our original e-ticket with seat assignments was ignored and we were forced to sit many rows apart from each other. We do not recommend SAA and will not take it again."
Claire,"August 16, 2017",South African Airways (Saa),4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,3,1,,,1,No,One of the worst airlines I’ve been on.  The aircraft fit out was old and the seats uncomfortable.  We had  4 people flying and on the flight out only 1 out of 4  screen worked and on the flight back non of the screens worked.  I estimate less than 50% of the entertainment screens were working.  The food was near inedible.  Given that the cost of this flight was on par or more expensive than alternatives on Qantas or Emirates there is no excuse.  The flight was only chosen because SAA have a monopoly over the Perth – Johnannesburg direct route. Will not be flying with them again.

Then delayed to 22:00.  4 hours delayed and they only gave one voucher for 100 ZAR for food for the first delay. For the second delay they didn’t want to give an extra voucher for the food. More importantly the ground crew leader looked like he was enjoying the frustrations of the customers complaining. He looked especially smug and was particularly rude. First and last time I will fly this airline. I will be sure to put this in social media not because of the delay but the type of people you seem to employ in your organization. Your employees have no respect, no regard for others and this tells me everything I need to know about your airline."

I actually had to show them that the port if faulty.  They came round with the paper (im in a row 5) and by the tine they got to me they did not have any other papers than Daily Express or something alike.

Eileen,"January 14, 2017",South African Airways (Saa),4.0,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,3,0,,,1,No,"Flew SAA from Durban to Hamburg with stops in Joburg and Munich. After delaying the flight in Joburg for several hours, we were then told that the flight is cancelled and we will fly out the next morning at 9am. SAA staff then made us collect their luggage, which took an hour, and then follow their staff to the hotel. The SAA ground staff could not find the hotel that was in the airport. Eventually we asked a cleaner where City Lodge hotel was and he gave us the directions. SAA only ordered a certain amount of rooms and I was the lucky person who got the last room after waiting for 3 hours in a queue with exhausted mothers, screaming babies and elderly people. The people behind me were then taken to another hotel at 3am where their shuttle broke down in the middle of the road. The next morning I had to get my bags re-sealed at my own cost. We get on the flight at 9am and then proceed to be delayed for another hour. I understand that flights get cancelled and delayed but taking 3-4 hours to get people in a hotel and having ground staff that don’t know where they are going and what they are doing is just unacceptable. Never again SAA. Never again."

Southwest rescheduled connecting flight even though we made the connection in time, so they would not allow us onboard purchased flight. We waited 8 hours for our connecting flight, arriving at 2am.

Jill,"April 24, 2023",Southwest Airlines,5.8,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Yes,I have had so many bad experiences with other airlines.  Southwest is family and military-friendly.  Their baggage policy is unmatched.  Their pilots always come out and say hello to my kids while we are boarding and/or getting off the plane.  The free movies and shows have saved me on long flights with 4 kids. Check-in is so easy.  Everyone I have come in contact with who works there has been so kind and helpful.  I had to contact customer service twice and they were so helpful and fixed my situation right away.  We will always fly Southwest whenever possible!

I have submitted a claim but no resolution yet. On our way back home our luggage was damaged. They gave me a credit for another flight with this company. A week later my husband received an alert on his credit report of a collector negative charge from this agency. We have never received a bill, call nothing to indicate we are in debt.

I was in loading bridge I made a comment to my husband “ why does she have to be so b———hy “ , she heard the comment and forbid me to fly on the flight. I do not feel that my comment would somehow put anyone in danger. The agent did not like my comment she decided to use her power to punish me. I will NEVER forget this as long as I live. This was caused by her using the power of the FAA giving airline employees the right to treat passengers any way they want. I try to avoid flying on them the employees have become increasingly rude on the ground. The flight attendants are not as bad but Southwest was always suppose to be the “fun airline”. This could not be further from the truth. It would be so nice to have a seat assignment."

Great customer service and public relations is horrible.  Wait times for phone calls are 60-90 minutes, the CSRs are rude and uncaring, and the early check in is a scam.  I purchased an early check in, 36 hours rather than 24 hours, to ensure a better chance of a seat at the front of the plane. instead, you cannot verify it even occurred, and cannot see any validation until the 24 hour window.

Jana,"January 3, 2020",Southwest Airlines,5.8,Flew Economy Class,9.0,4,4,5,3,5,,2,Yes,"Be careful when renting a car through Southwest.  They offer special deals on rental cars but we found the cost to be more than if we had rented directly with Enterprise.  We were charged $10.00 per day for the extra driver which when booked directly through Enterprise (as the wife) would have been no charge.  So for seven days, that was an additional $70.00. Also, there was a large upcharge as we kept the car for additional days. The total bill came to over $1000.00 for 7 days! Not even a full size car.   Definitely a special deal – but not for us."

So we “no-showed” because we only had an option to cancel both flights and not just the 1st flight. So they then cancelled our return flight as well and kept $1,200. They were then semi-rude on the phone. This policy is a joke and I have done this 2 other times for a past United flight and they did not do this. No wonder Southwest stock is half as much as United stock. Terrible & greedy company."

Now, you can buy much more affordable tickets, add the price of checked bags and still be less than southwest. We fly an average of 5 times a year (always on southwest) and this is our 4th time this year being ridiculously delayed. If it’s possible to even catch our connection, we will be running. And stressed to the max. To be even more annoying, every flight we’ve done this year, we’ve seen blokes holding seats for their family they were too cheap to buy preboard tickets for. Why is this allowed? They also let people with their grown ass kids get on with the kids under 6. You charge people extra then don’t even stick to your own rules! And the worst, we chose this flight to spend the least amount of time in the airport possible, now we’re just sitting sitting sitting… FOR FIVE HOURS."

Edward,"July 4, 2019",Southwest Airlines,5.8,Flew Economy Class,5.0,4,3,4,4,5,5,4,Yes,"Simply put, SWA is overrated. The biggest complaint is the boarding process.  It is advertised as this entirely democratic, first-come-first served system. The reality is quite different. Despite going on their website exactly 24 hours ahead of departure, we ended up in about the middle of the line. Priority is now given to those willing to pay a fee or who are enrolled in their credit card or whatever. The three of us almost ended up not getting to sit together.  Thankfully, on the remaining legs of the trip, the kind gate agents let us priority board despite the fact that our child is over six. I will not name the routes to protect them. Otherwise, it was okay. SWA is not bad, it simply is not the leader it used to be."
kona,"April 29, 2019",Southwest Airlines,5.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,1,0,No,"Sadly, Southwest practices are unethical and I won’t be flying with this airline again. The day I booked, I specifically shopped for a nonstop flight on various airlines. I could have booked a connecting flight for much less. However, we are traveling to my daughter’s wedding with many bags of decorations, wedding clothes, etc., and we also wanted to avoid rechecking bags at a connection for an international flight, so we chose to pay more for a nonstop. Now that Southwest is losing money for grounding the Max 8, they changed our flight to a connecting flight without any compensation and refusing to change our flight to a nonstop out of a different airport. We are losing the money we could have had if we had bought a connecting fare in the first place and if take the option of canceling, we lose money on the fare increase since booking. So Southwest wins this round. But we will not be flying Southwest again due to this bait and switch unethical way of doing business."

We were told to gate 41 where another aircraft will take us to Mumbai at 9 PM. When we reached gate 41, another flight was boarding and the executives at gate 41 told us that there was never a departure plan of the said flight. We were suddenly panicking. We, then,  rushed to the display board and read that the same aircraft ( parked at gate 49) will take us to Mumbai after repairs. I want to ask the airlines why did they lie to us. When there was no plan to arrange another aircraft, why did they tell us to go to gate 41. This amounts to ‘Lying’ and I call it cheating. They are cheaters and I call it a shameful act on part of Spice Jet. ( for not telling us the truth and buying time). While many airlines buy time in such delays, See jet had innovated this new Lie.

Neerudha,"September 10, 2018",Spicejet,2.8,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"Spicejet Review – I’d like to tell that I am a sort of family traveler and I usually travel not alone but along with my mother. She has completed over 56 years of age. Unfortunately, she suffers from Osteomalacia, which is a bone degenerating disease that consequently causes fragile bones. Due to this, we stay cautious while she moves. So, thinking about our flight, Spicejet has been our only preference owing to its consistent performance against our needs and required assistance onboard and on the ground. It all has started on our first flight with Spicejet. We still remember its cabin crew, Priti that made our first flight a pleasant memory to uphold till now. For SpiceJet review, she makes an important acknowledgment as she provided generous support during our onboard journey and assisted my mother while reaching to seats and while deboarding the flight, too. At no point in time, we felt her as a stranger, she treated as if we are one family and my mother was utterly comforted by this. Similar sort of experiences has been in common flying Spicejet till date with the airliner. We truly admire this gesture from Spicejet."

It starts with a sight of a heavy rush during morning hours at Delhi airport, which is a common knowledge and most people will try & reach early to avoid any unwanted issues. However, nothing can prepare you for long queues and that too, Delhi crowd! However, I am amazed at the level-headedness and dexterity of the ground staff at airports. In this case, SpiceJet who manage such an unruly crowd so nonchalantly that gives the most seasoned customer care professionals goosebumps in their midsection. Within 10 mins I had my boarding pass and then ushered to the waiting coach whizzing past the security check. Kudos to Priyanka, the check-in counters executive and thank you to SpiceJet."

The flight was supposed to depart from Kolkata at 9.30 PM, but was cancelled at the last moment. Technical problems are not extraordinary circumstances unless they are the type that you could not expect to encounter when operating a flight. This kind of cancellations happened more than three times with me particularly in this route. I just want to know why this kind of things happens with spice jet only. Today we suffered a lot for this cancellation and we did not get the correct answer for that. Yours sincerely, Mc Sl"
Michael,"August 31, 2023",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,,1,1,No,Absolutely terrible service and incompetent staff. I was never notified of my original flight being delayed three hours. I was however notified 12 times of my connecting flight being delayed. Was forced to sit on the plane in the taxi area behind my connecting flight for ten minutes while we waited for our gate to open. Spirit had one person staffed for an entire plane of people who needed new connections but they refused to hold a connecting flight for 30 more seconds so that people could make their connection. They then forced us all to wait 9 hours sleeping on the flour because they wouldn’t let us onto the plane they delayed us from getting on. I will never fly Spirit again and I hope they’re out of business soon all their employees are incredibly rude and act like their laziness is your fault.
Carla,"August 9, 2023",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,"CONFIRMATION # LLW4WA – Purchased insurance with my ticket. Had death in the family and tried to change the ticket. I ended up cancelling the ticket instead because spirit wanted to charge an additional $119 to change the ticket. They charged me an additional $44.20 to cancel and told me to call Travel Guard for a reimbursement. Travel Guard tells me that the death of my first cousin is not covered. So now I’m s.o.l.. Did not get a refund for the airline ticket or the cancel fee. I never fly Spirit because of past horrible experiences but was making a very quick trip with no luggage and thought I would try it. DON’T DO IT!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THE INSURANCE IS A SCAM. EVEN IF YOU PAY FOR THE INSURANCE, THEY HAVE ONLY CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE COVERED. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS ONLY ABOUT MAKING A BUCK."
Tanzeela,"August 9, 2023",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,0,0,0,,,0,No,"This is the worst airline to travel. Honestly, travel by foot if you have to, but not on this plane. They do not have refund policies, all they can do is reimburst you on your upcoming flight with them within 180 days. So if you’re not planning to fly again within 180 days using Spirit, you basically loose your money. They have this annoying tune at the back that starts as soon as you land, and will not stop unless the airplane is connected to a gate. In my case, the airplane couldn’t find a gate for over 60 minutes, and all that while this ridiculous tune kept one playing. Moreover, when I complained about it to their air hostess cause it was giving me a headache, they were super rude about it, told me this is not an emergency for which I called them, its not their problem and they can do nothing about it."
Greg,"August 9, 2023",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,1,0,No,"Planned a three day trip to Vegas. Flew Spirit out of Detroit. The flight was delayed 9+ hours. Boarding should have occurred on or about 9:20 pm on June 1 with a take off of 10:02 pm. The flight took off at 6:20 am the following morning June 2. Frustrated customers were given the choice for refund or to book on another Spirit Flight. Customers were so angry with the gate agents and Spirit for the delays, lack of communication and overall attitude that local police were brought to the gate to supervise Spirit’s shenanigans.  No food vouchers, no hotel vouchers, rebook a flight, only Sprit was offered. Tried to resolve with customer service. No response from Spirit’s CEO, and Spirit’s customer service agent was useless. During the process of dealing with customer service, I had booked a flight with Spirit in September for which I asked them to cancel and refund. Even with all the issues, they would only provide a credit for the flight and charged a $69 cancellation fee."

Canceled our origins flight to Cancun less than 4 hours before and rebooked us on a flight two hours earlier than the first that we almost missed. Sent us across country, causing us to lose a day of our vacation. On flight home, sat in check in lines forever and they closed boarding for our flight 5 minutes early and wouldn’t let us on even though we were within the time window. Rude and unhelpful. Spent 18 hours trying to get home because of it. Worst experience ever. Also after all the fees, baggage costs, seat prices and costs of beverages and food on flight including the time we lost on our vacation and extra day off work, we should have just paid more for a better reliable experience on delta."
Jill,"April 24, 2023",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"The absolute worst airline there is.  Wouldn’t let us check our bags because we were literally 1 minute late.  Then the plane sat on the tarmac for an hour.  We had to book another flight.  The lady at the counter was rude and unhelpful.  I had a lap child and there is nowhere to note that when booking.  I called the airport and it was impossible to get anyone on the phone.  When I showed up for my flight, like they told me to, and they would handle the lap child at check-in…they made a huge deal about it saying I should have taken care of it before my flight, which I TRIED to do.  Another flight got canceled 5 minutes before boarding. They didn’t know when we could get another flight so we DROVE home across the country with 12 people in a van we had to rent.  They nickel and dime for baggage, seats, and anything else they can.  You. end up paying more.  Save yourself the hassle and just fly Southwest instead."

After canceling our flight because of the “climate” (but there were no storms on the forecast until later in the week), they offered only to change our flights to one 4 days later. They didn’t put us in a hotel or Airbnb (even for one night to be able to make other plans) nor did they give us a food voucher for the airport (which is like the minimum they could do)."
Editors,"April 2, 2022",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Do not be lured by the ”bargain” price. Nothing about Spirit Airlines is a bargain. You will end up paying way more as they charge you for luggage and other amenities after they mess up your flight.
Daniela,"January 9, 2022",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"The worst airline! I could not check in on a flight to Colombia because I did not have a return ticket (which other airlines like AA don’t require) so I took a few minutes next to the counter to purchase the ticket and when I returned, the flight had closed.

Emily,"October 5, 2021",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Utterly the worst flight ever! Spirit Airlines is an ultra-low-cost carrier airline but they end up putting extra changes so you end up paying more. This was the ‘WORST’ experience because: 1. The flight was delayed for approx. 2 hours. 2. They have the worse in-flight services and no hygiene. 3. The seats were uncomfortable and at night and I couldn´t sleep because of that. Also, there was small sharp light above my seat that was broken – it was not possible to switch it off! So the light was shining on me all night. Thus I booked my return flight ticket with Delta airline which was a little steeper thus I booked it through an online flight booking portal as it offered unpublished fare prices for extra savings! Please don’t book any flight with Spirit Airlines but if you face any situation like me contact +1-888-720-1433 for cheap return flights."
Matthew,"November 14, 2020",Spirit Airlines,2.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,0,1,0,,,0,No,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. If you can avoid using Spirit Airlines, AVOID IT. I never never dealt with more incompetent customer service reps who care less about the customer. We booked a flight going into Ohare, Illinois before the governor put all the restrictions in. I understand the cancellation policy, but this is very much an extenuating circumstance. Instead of trying to win my business, take care of me, or communicate in a charitable manner, the reps were extremely rude on the phone, kept talking over me, repeating themselves incessantly, and refused to give any real solution outside of a credit with severe limitations, AND that credit was not even the full amount of the fare? Seriously? A money hungry business like this does not deserve your business. There are better airlines who actually CARE about their customers and are giving refunds during the pandemic. With Covid affecting how people operate, you would think Spirit would take notice and actually start refunding  fares under circumstances where the state starts closing off travel, but when a company cares more about money than the customer, people lose. YOU WILL LOSE. Stay away from this awful airline."

Max,"June 12, 2017",Spring Airlines,5.3,Flew Economy,7.0,3,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"I flew from Taipei to Shanghai. I think this airline was okay, I sat just behind the premium class in the front of the plane and the leg space was okay for me. (I’m almost 2m tall). I’ve only felt like I paid a little bit too much compared to my other flights in this trip. I wasn’t bothered during the flight with unnecessary advertisements. Ground staff was friendly with helping arranging the Chinese visa exemption, there was a long queue for the check-ins but they opened up the business class and priority desks for economy passengers after a few minutes. I think this is a good choice if you can find a cheap deal for it."
Wendale,"March 13, 2017",Spring Airlines,5.3,Flew Economy,8.0,5,3,4,0,,,0,Yes,"Best value for money. As the first low-cost airline company, Spring offers you the best prices (usually) for domestic flights. I booked this one-way flight in early February for 350 RMB(YUAN) in total, cheaper than both trains and bullet trains for the same place of departure and destination (from Shenzhen to Hangzhou)! Perhaps because it’s an early flight taking off at 6:20 am, the cabin was really quiet the whole trip. And there wasn’t any promotion of products by the cabin staff as many complained about, nor did the stewardess teach us to do some stretches. But the luggage limits are a little tight, only a bag of 7 kilograms on board and without any free check-in luggage. So you’d better book your check-in luggage online and pay for it, otherwise it will cost you more in the airport. You don’t have much legroom since Spring aircrafts often have 180 seats (other airline companies always have 150 seats for the same type). And for the economy class, there weren’t any free meals or drinks which you have to buy on board. All in all, you shouldn’t miss Spring Airlines if you do not have lots of baggage and want to save tons of money."

As per the airline rules advertised on their website all north American passengers are allowed to carry 2 pieces of luggage of 23 kilos each in economy class. Our group which was consisted of 4 members had encountered an issues with their crew at counter . They denied the 2 piece allowance for two passengers in our group and other two were allowed to check in 2 pieces . two rules for same group of passengers who paid and downloaded the tickets at the same time from SriLankan airlines website… We ended up paying $500 USD for the luggage even though we were entitled as per their own rules . We didn’t want to miss the flight afterall.. crew kept arguing with us like bunch of street cab drivers looting our money in a foreign country where we don’t want to miss the travel ..well they won .. apparently they lost future fliers from my family  we lodged a formal complaint to SriLankan authorities and nothing happened other than ” you are wrong not SriLankan” typical reply ..

Ronald,"July 27, 2018",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Business Class,9.0,5,5,5,4,,,4,Yes,"Sri Lanka Air’s (SLA) business class fares are a good deal. Usually business fares are 3x to 4x more than economy. Not so with SLA; my business fare was $356, slightly double that of economy. That gains you entry to the Serendib lounge at Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. While the lounge has seen better days, there’a good buffet and travelers are entitled to free showers and a 15-minute head massage. As I had a 7:50 am flight the lounge was not crowded. While SLA has newer Airbus 330-300 with individualized seats in business class, this flight makes do with the older 330-200 with adjoining seats. I lucked out and had both seats to myself. The breakfast menu offered an extensive tea selection and several meal entrees. What’s nice is SLA’s direct flight lands at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi (BKK) airport with speedy rail service into the city. Air Asia, while offering the cheapest economy fare, needs a stop over in Kuala Lumpur and lands at Don Muang (DMK) airport – less convenient than BKK. Given the near 4-hour flight, extensive breakfast selection, lounge access with free shower and spacious seating, it was well worth the business class fare."
Kumari,"May 17, 2018",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Sri Lankan Airlines are one of the worst airlines I have flown with. I agree with other reviews that they refuse to handle complaints and deny any wrongdoing, choosing to blame the passenger instead. The check in staff at the airport are extremely rude. Although they can appear to be pleasant to foreign tourists, they are hostile to Sri Lankans and other Asians, in my experience and after discussions with many of my friends. On my last flight, I reached the check in desk in the queue one hour and 20 minutes before my flight, but they turned me away saying I was too late. This was despite the fact that they had already weighed my luggage and processed the passengers in front of me and subsequently the passengers behind me. The problem seemed to be that I had a voucher for extra baggage after trading in my Airmiles which the check in staff were not happy about. I had to purchase a new ticket for the following day at great expense and inconvenience. I contacted the customer complaints department in their office who were not interested in this issue or a refund. They falsely claimed that the reason I was denied boarding was due to a heavy suitcase (I transferred some items to another case) and late. However they could not explain if this was the case, why did they weigh my luggage and process others in the queue? I strongly recommend that you do not use Sri Lankan Airlines!!!"
Emma,"March 7, 2018",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Business Class,9.0,5,4,5,4,,,5,Yes,"I had lost faith in airline travel until I recently flew SriLankan Airlines return from Dubai to Singapore. I was quite impressed with the ease of check-in, attentiveness of the cabin crew and the tasty meals that were served. The flight attendants wore a smile that made you feel comfortable and at ease to be flying with them. They were attentive and eager to assist with any questions. The aircraft was comfortable and the toilets were clean for duration of the trip. I was especially happy that they were quick to answer when their help was needed and very polite. It has been quite disappointing for me in recent years to see the decline in customer service, when travelling by air, regardless of the cabin flown. My worst experience has been with United and Turkish Airline. The cabin crew act like they are doing you a favor and God forbid you ask for assistance. It was really refreshing to see that some airlines still take a lot of pride in excellent customer service. Keep it up SriLankan Airlines. I hope you can eventually expand your destinations to include North America as I can guarantee you that you have one truly satisfied customer."
Sean,"January 22, 2018",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,1,2,1,,,2,No,"We flew back from Colombo to Dubai and feel completely cheated by Sri Lankan Air. As a special treat we paid for business class seats for my wife’s 30th but got the oldest plane I’ve ever flown on that was not even worth an economy fair. I get that this sounds like ‘first world problens’ but our issue is that we were sold an expensive service by Sri Lankan and they didn’t deliver. If they’d told us that they wouldn’t offer the service advertised then we wouldn’t have paid the extra money for business – we actually would have flown economy with Emirates and got a much better service. We made a complaint immediately to Sri Lankan and it took them 3 weeks to reply – of course they couldn’t offer anything other than a weak response. Terrible customer service, terrible airline – Avoid at all costs as there are much better options to get to Sri Lanka."
David,"September 21, 2017",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,2,No,"Horrendous experience, the airline failed to tell us about a five hour delay until we had checked in, by which time we had passed all security points and were told we could not leave under any circumstances. Airline staff didn’t seem to care, people were upset everywhere, I suppose they already had our money so it didn’t matter. We were told we would be given a meal voucher once we cleared immigration, so with little choice we went . Once we reached the ‘slop counter’ we were told to go to was a grossly inadequate offer of food, I wasn’t sure how long it had been there but I wouldn’t have chanced it on my dog. I decided to talk to the customer desk and ask them to at least provide us with a cash equivalent value for the slop counter, obviously this wasn’t on sale to the general public as it looked inedible, but still I believed I was entitled to something. Customer services didn’t care, neither do their internet team, Sandakumari Ekanayake in particular has made i clear they have no interest in any type of customer service, and has lied directly about the flight details. Colombo airport is one of the most expensive airports I have visited and it was literally 18 USD each for a safe meal. My bottom line is this airline is fine if things go well, but fundamentally if things go wrong you are absolutely screwed, heed my advice unless they are rally cheap book a more reputable airline, my underlining feeling is this is how they treat customers, god only knows how they feel about safety…"
Shanna,"July 13, 2017",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Economy,2.0,4,4,3,4,,,3,Yes,"Had a bad experience as I did not get free accomodation for a 21 hour layover as stated in the email I received after asking if I was eligible for it before I flew.

J,"July 5, 2017",Srilankan Airlines,5.2,Flew Business,1.0,1,2,1,2,,,2,No,"Having recently travelled on multiple Sri Lankan Airlines flights I can confirm the other passengers complaints of old and tired planes, disappointing in flight entertainment options and very poor food (both in terms of taste and also rapidly running out of options). However, all of this could be overlooked if some attention was given to improving customer service!! The ticket prices are not cheap, so to find yourself being spoken down to by arrogant and rude staff from check in through to on the plane is simply unacceptable. On every flight we took, we were taken aback by how rudely the staff spoke to us at all times during – it didn’t seem to matter which class we flew either, we were met with short, sharp responses in business and economy! Customer services can really make or break a trip, so if you value being treated well and spoken to politely then I would not recommend booking with Sri Lankan."

Boarding ok, they call business and priorities first, on board no choices, it`s either spicy vegetarian or spicy vegetarian, flight on time, no AVOD system and the tickets were no cheap, no doubt they are going through some bad financial times."

However, at the airport they charged IDR 65,000 p/KG, which meant this flight cost me as much as 2 Air Asia flights, URT-KUL and KUL-DPS, and caused me much stress as they didn’t accept cards so had to run around the airport changing money."

Aircraft used on these trips are very well worn (let’s say shabby) Boeing 737-500s that are clearly in need of an interior refurbishment.

Tobi,"March 15, 2016",Sriwijaya Air,4.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"Nam air cancelled its route and forced all passenger to collect the refund within 3 days to the office. I once visited their counter in the airport and the employee was gone somewhere abandoning their office. I was on the trip and was unable to go to the other office and asked for online refund. They refused to help me on any of this matter and instead told me to ask my online travel agent without giving any guarantee. It is so ridiculous, my first and last time using this unproffesional airline"
Daniel,"January 10, 2016",Sriwijaya Air,4.8,Flew Economy,9.0,4,4,5,0,,,4,Yes,"3 weeks ago, I was on SJ555 from Surabaya to Ternate using their 737-400. I got to admit, it was quite pleasant. Although it’s a little bit cold. Since it was a 3 hour flight, they give us complimentary food (Fried Rice or something), it was ok. There was no flight entertainment, but that’s fine because most of the passengers were sleeping and I was playing Flight Simulator #flightception. Cabin crew were super friendly. The landing was OK not rough but not smooth either. This airline is my choice if I have to go to visit Ternate."
Leony,"December 1, 2015",Sriwijaya Air,4.8,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,5,Yes,"2 hour flight from Jakarta to Denpasar, Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ272 with their Boeing 737-500 Winglets. The flight was quite full, i think about 90% loaded. Cabin crews are very friendly with passengers and also offering help for disabled pax who need special safety instruction(they announced it after safety demo).  As usual when you flying with Sriwijaya Air, you will also got some snacks or meals, depending on distance you flying with. Another good point, beside the smooth flight. they also done a smooth landing. Looking forward to fly with Sriwijaya Air again soon."

Have really only two things to criticize in, 1: difficult with legroom (185cm), 2: somewhat dry bread that we got. Because of the short flight, the incredibly nice staff makes up these two complaints! I will book this airline in the future!"
Vaclav,"October 14, 2018",Starperu,5.0,Flew Economy Class,5.0,4,4,5,2,,,4,No,"Once you get on the flight it’s quite nice. You get a drink and a meal even on very short flights (45min) and everyone is nice and friendly. We took 3 flights with StarPeru. One of them changed the departure time, but we were acknowledged in advance. The second one was done in partnership with Latin American Wings and when we arrive to the airport they told us, that they cancelled cooperation with StarPeru because the company was not paying them. They however placed us on the next flight for free. Since the following flight from StarPeru was rescheduled for earlier time and we arrived late we had 45 minutes for international transfer in Lima (with language pickup) which we have miraculously managed and enjoy the next flight to Cusco so happy that in the end everything worked."
Hansel,"August 18, 2023",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,2,,,3,No,"Sun Country in the past has been a very reliable and affordable airline for me, but my experience them during this recent July 4th holiday was a total disaster.  My family and I booked a trip from San Francisco to Minneapolis/Saint Paul more than 6 months in advance.  On our return flight on July 9th, when we were already at the airport, they first delayed their flight for a few hours, then canceled it altogether.  We had to return home as soon as possible for our work and kids and they booked a return flight for us, at a cost of $1,800 more on top of the refund of their own flight.  When I politely asked them to cover the cost for the difference, they just outright refused.  I don’t plan to ever fly with them again, I believe their management has just cut staffing to the point they cannot even handle known high volume periods such as holidays.  I just can’t trust Sun Country ever again after a horrible, frustrating experience like this."
Samantha,"June 12, 2023",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,0,No,Very very disappointed with the customer service of this airline.
Brian,"September 8, 2022",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,3,0,,,0,No,We booked four first flight with Sun Country in June. The night before our flight I looked up the flight information to get the gate and found out the flight had been cancelled. Because we were in Seattle the customer service desk was already shut down for the day so we had to wait until the next morning to get help. The customer service rep was very kind and helpful. She confirmed the cancellation was due to crew issues. The next available flight for our family was in 7 days which is obviously not a valid option. She did offer a full refund and we have received that. But we had to rebook 5 new tickets for the next day which also added another hotel night and rental car day. It cost us an additional $2500.
Leanne,"April 9, 2022",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,Deplorable customer Service.  Purchased a ticket and then contracted COVID.  Could not reach the Airline to either change or cancel my flight due to the illness.  Customer service was overwhelmed and could not be reached.  They offered us to leave a voice message and they would return the call.  That never happened. The online experience was also very disappointing.  Portions of the site were not operational and you could not get the the area to change or cancel a flight.  This Airline is very “Sub Grade”.  Don’t fly Sun Country if you expect a respectable level of customer service.  Their service is awful and we truly believe they don’t care. Sun Country is Terrible!!
Albert,"February 25, 2022",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"First and last time flying with sun country airlines. Avoid this airlines if possible, this people don’t care about your stuff. I traveled last week and they damaged one of my luggage when I arrived at my destination. After making a huge line in Madison Wisconsin because they only had one staff, with my wife and two toddlers I was told they had no time to help me to fill out a form or call customer service. After arriving at the hotel I called and made the claim long story short of back and forth emails its been over a week and they finally offered me a twenty dollar refund for my close to five hundred dollar luggage. If you have expensive things or care about your stuff stay away from this airlines. Horrible customer service!"
Jeff,"October 9, 2019",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,The worst company ever! I was supposed to fly out Aug 1st to Minnesota. Flight was delayed all day. They booked me on the next flight Aug. Delayed. They were to refund my money in 7-10 business days. Still have not received. I will tell everyone I know never to fly this airline!
Patricia,"August 30, 2019",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,0,0,0,,1,0,No,"Sun Country check-in lines were insane and ruined our travel plans. We had already checked in online and it took 3 hours to get checked in and then after that TSA was pretty quick. Sun Country literally closed the door in my face and told my husband and I we would have to wait to fly standby the next day. As I was running towards the door they closed it and never did they announce our names for the flight. There were other couples in our same situation at the door. It was as if we had never purchased a ticket for the flight. This is no longer the airline that was owned by Cambria. The lack of customer service, the fees for everything, and the inability to get you to your destination on time makes them a poor choice for anyone looking to get where they are going at a reasonable rate and with reasonable service. Never again!!!"
Kirsten,"August 4, 2019",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,3,3,1,1,,3,Yes,"Long lines for check in are ridiculous! Sunday we spent nearly an hour in line to get to the attendant and be told we were 5 minutes late. We had not arrived to the front check in by the 45 minutes prior to the flight. Need more than 3 people checking people in, more curb side check in or employees alerting passengers last call for flights leaving in 45 minutes. The line on Sunday was down the Humphrey terminal for all the sun country flights leaving at about the same time. I’ll prepared airlines. My fault for not arriving 2 hours prior to a domestic flight in the smaller Humphrey airport , but hard to anticipate for a 630 am Sunday flight. But the airline likely overbooked and our seats were sold. My family of four lost a day of vacation since the next available flight was the following morning. We arrived an extra hour early to find the lines nearly as long. Add more check in agents if u have so many flights taking off at the same time sun country!"
Jayne,"July 25, 2019",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,No,"Sun country cares not for the comfort or needs of their customers. I had a severe back injury the day before flying with Sun Country. My flight was delayed and then cancelled in MSP (My flight was from ORD-PDX). They did not provide timely hotel accommodations. They promised reimbursement for per diem and transportation to and from accommodations. No agent I spoke with could give me a straightforward answer. Their customer care lines take 90minutes or more to speak with a representative. They do not get back to you in a timely manner, hoping you’ll give up and they won’t have to make up for their shortcomings. I hope no one I know will have the displeasure of ever flying with them again."

Susan,"May 29, 2019",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,3,1,2,3,No,"Checked luggage never arrived. Spent a long time in the airport filling out paperwork. We were told that if the luggage containing lots of our camping gear was not delivered before we had to leave for our camping trip, that the cost for replacement equipment would be reimbursed and we should save our receipts. Luggage was delivered well after our departure time (had to make arrangements for it to be delivered to friends). We have submitted receipts and all pertinent information twice by paper and regular mail and at least 5 times by email. I have spent hours on the phone trying to find someone whose job it is to address this situation to no avail. I’ve yet to receive one response and 9 months later we are still waiting for our reimbursement."
Jenna,"January 3, 2019",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,,,1,No,"Trip from MSP to PDX the seats were so small, my 6′ husband was crammed. PDX to MSP (1/1/19, flight 294) was even worse. Sign showed as “on time” but no plane. Then we started boarding at the time we were supposed to be taking off and we sat on the plane for 1 hr 10 min. Although they updated us about every 20 minutes, still ridiculous. When we were about to take off, my 5 year old was watching a movie quietly and this attendant (mid-50’s, shorter dark brown hair) came over and said that he had to either have no volume or wear headphones – I have taken dozens of plane trips and have NEVER heard of that. Then they didn’t have most snacks that were on the menu. Then when we were getting ready to land, the same attendant came over to me and my 3 year old as he was not wanting to buckle and tried to forcibly buckle him. She didn’t put her hands on him but I was already working with him to get him to. In addition, there was no wifi, no screens, etc. and we had to pay extra just for regular seats and for baggage (understandable)… we booked with them because it would save us about $400 for all 4 of us but definitely not worth it between the service, amenities and extra fees. I will never fly with them again."
Amanda,"September 13, 2018",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,1,,,2,No,"Sun Country left my luggage somewhere during a recent trip to Vegas. My husband and I had packed in one bag and had no clothing or toiletries. I had to purchase toothpaste, toothbrushes, and contact lens solution and cases, and wash my travel clothes in our hotel tub. THEN to top it off, it’s one month later and we still have yet to receive any confirmation of our claim, or any response at all from their “service” department. Terrible service. Will not fly again, and do not recommend."
Gregory,"July 24, 2017",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,Horrible customer service…. Would not even recommend this airline to my worst enemy…  They bumped me on my flight and told me I need to wait around LAX for 6 hours till their next flight.  I only booked this as it was a preferred airline for my travel agent…  I think I need a new travel agent.  When I told them their attitude and what they did was F’ed up they called airport police on me…  Funny as Airport police was pissed off at them for calling them without cause.
Soumen,"January 7, 2016",Sun Country Airlines,2.2,Flew Economy,5.0,3,1,4,0,,,4,No,Took Sun Country Airlines for the first time from SFO to MSP. Took a red-eye flight while going and it was a decent experience.

S.,"August 2, 2014",Sun Express,3.7,Flew Economy,9.0,4,3,5,2,,,2,Yes,"This review is about SunExpress DEUTSCHLAND. About 2 weeks ago, our flight from Marsa Alam (flight XG4070) got a long delay. But we want to thank everybody from SunExpress Deutschland for how they took care of the costumers that moment, and afterwards with a nice compensation for our troubles. A company that takes full responsibility when necessary, and instead of 7 hours of chaos, travellers seems to just get some extra hours of vacation. Thank you, to the whole team, who have helped all of the 120 travellers with most care. The travelagent at the airport, the busdrivers, the Tulip hotel wich took us in, the groundpersonnel for the quick boarding when we really could leave Egypt, the crew on the flight, and ofcourse also the personel that takes care of our complaints afterwards. You all did a great job, and we only can recommend you to our friends and family. To book a flight without any worries if there should be some problem. If necessary SunExpress Deutschland takes the responsibilty. A lot of the bigger compagnies can take some lessons from this! Thank you, your whole team!"
farnoosh,"May 14, 2020",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,No,"I was following up as I we have not received any updates from anyone since October 2019 after we returned  from our disasters wedding. this is very concerning to me as the photographer was also supposed to send us a copy of the raw footage of the Wedding and he hasn’t and we are not able to get a hold of him. I am writing to express my deepest disappointment in the services provided during the wedding last week. Your resort does an amazing job of marketing services and upselling to more premium product. Knowing that this was our wedding, we placed our trust in you to deliver on the services that were said to be provided. Below is an insight to some of the larger discrepancies. On top of me going back and forth three days to the Riu Palace because they couldn’t take a payment every couple hours I have to walk back to that Resort spoke to a gentleman by the name of angel because our wedding coordinator made it very adamant that everything has to be paid before the ceremony"
Richard,"February 12, 2020",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,No,We get to the airport and the personal at the Swoop/Sunwing check-in desk tell us the flight is delayed by 9 hours. They said we were sent an email but we checked in front of them and there was no email. They were very rude and unapologetic. They just told us to come back in 9 hours!! No voucher of any kind was offered. This is very bad service and we are never flying Swoop or Sunwing again. We have flown to the Caribbean many times from other airlines and always form Pearson Airport and never seen such treatment. From now on it’s Air Canada and West Jet only
Eugene,"December 15, 2019",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,3,1,3,2,1,No,"We booked our vacation in May 2019 to celebrate our  30th anniversary in Oct. 2019. Purchased all their upgrades especially the extra leg room as I am going in for knee surgery shortly and need the extra leg room as I can not keep my knee bent for extended periods of time. They changed our flight 3 different times, paid for 9 days,.First day we never got to our resort until midnight last day we left resort 7 am losing 2 complete days of our vacation. Arrived to Toronto airport to check in they told us there were no seats on this flight with extra leg room, we argued with them explaining my situation with no success. Guess what, when we boarded the seats we purchased were there they sold them to someone else. They  bold face lied to us.We will never use them again. Be very careful booking with this airline because all this scumball company want is your money and then screw you."
Jackie,"December 3, 2019",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,No,"eps were rude throughout the process. After they received contract and deposit they didn’t care anymore. They wouldn’t answer for days, no effort was made unless I got mngt involved. The staff recommended the Riu Jalisco and gave us a rate of over $1500 per person but it did not include the wedding portion. But with amount of people coming and that paid deposits, ours would have been comp’d so it would have been ok. After everything was signed and paid I found out that the Riu Palace (right next door) had a free wedding package so I requested to move to that one which I was told was going to be $1800 per person. Later on I found out that they gave the Riu Palace to others for $1400 per person. Which then we would have had good service, a free wedding and an amazing honeymoon. Had the worst time of my life. When compliant was made to Sunwing they just passed on my info to the hotel and then said case closed. They offered us a $100 travel voucher which is a slap in the face! There was snotty Kleenex in Pocket behind seat and Gum under Armrest"
Madison,"June 5, 2019",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,No,"I would never recommend this airline to anyone. After going to Cayo Santa Maria back in February we will never choose Sunwing again. From the moment we boarded the plain there were 2 extremely intoxicated disruptive passengers in which they continued to serve alcohol to during the whole 7 hour flight. We had an unknown stopover in Cayo Coco where we were made land, exit the aircraft, leave all belongings onboard, go through security, wait in the airport for about an hour, then re board the flight for a 20 minute flight to our destination. No one was aware of this and every passenger was extremely furious with this. We then experienced MANY issues at our resort in which our Rep was beyond useless and when we brought all of our issues to the attention of sunwing when we returned home they were less than useless and inconsiderate when it came to compensation or resolving any issues."
Aurora,"February 5, 2019",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,1,,,2,No,The plan was approx 10 hours late both ways. We complained to the airline and did not bother to answer

Tamie,"November 15, 2018",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"I was supposed to go to Cuba in 2017, but unfortunately, hurricane Irma had other ideas and we had to use our cancellation insurance. This is when the nonsense began. Sunwing refused to refund our trip and used their “discretion” to issue us a credit. Fine. A year later, we were told our voucher was expiring. Umm, what? I don’t think so. More hassles to get the voucher extended an extra month. We decided to just book our vacation to get our money back. When I called to apply the voucher for $1720, I was told their procedure was that I pay the full amount of the vacation and then I would be reimbursed within 3 weeks. Ummm, what? That is just ridiculous. However, I had no choice. I had to either put it on my credit card or lose the money altogether. I’m not working right now, so I have limited means to pay this money off. Flash forward one month. I’ve been on my vacation and back for four days. Still no money and I’ve had to pay the amount on credit card or risk paying interest on charges that NEVER should have been on my credit card in the first place. I call Sunwing and ask what is going on. I’m then told that they can take up to 6 weeks to reimburse the money they never should have taken from my credit card. Are you seriously joking? Sunwing’s cancellation insurance is complete nonsense. We had to pay $50 each to be robbed and treated like garbage. This is terrible company. When I called company to file a complaint, I was put through to a booking agent, who couldn’t do anything for me and couldn’t refer me to anyone who can. I have to just keep waiting and hope that one day they give me my money back. I have booked with Sunwing before and this is not the first set of issues I’ve had, but it will be the last. This is a bottom of the barrel company and I would not recommend ever using them. The airline is terrible. No entertainment at all on a 7 hour flight, dirty planes with small seats and little leg room"
jiji,"July 10, 2018",Sunwing Airlines,2.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,1,No,"My sister and I booked a 4 day package from Montreal to Cancun which includes flight/all inclusive hotel with transport from and to the hotel. Due to an emergency, I had to fly a day later. I called Sunwing to ask if I can move my date by one day, they said no which I accepted; after all, it was unexpected. I bought a separate flight to cancun the day after. I asked if I could get a ride from the airport to the hotel the next day, again, I was told no which I thought was unreasonable. The shuttle goes to the airport every day anyway, they could have let me get the transportation since I didn’t use it the day before. So I ended up paying $47 for a taxi to the hotel. The next day I went to the sunwing representative at the resort to confirm my shuttle back to the airport on my date of departure. Freddy reassured me that they had my booking and that I was good to go. The day of the check out, to my surprise, the shuttle had my sister’s name but not mine!!! He refused to take me to the airport even though I had confirmed it, I PAID for it, he didn’t want to hear anything. After I made a huge scene and made it clear that I had to get on the shuttle or I’d miss my flight, the driver let me on but only after he took down all of my details because ”he would get in trouble” To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. This was a very expensive holiday, I should have bought the flights and hotel on my own instead of going through Sunwing. My flight to Cancun with Interjet was 10 times better than my return flight with Sunwing (and cheaper might I add). When I called sunwing about the change in my outbound flight, they said they could book me a flight for $385 when I checked online, I booked interjet for $250, you must be taking the piss! I will NEVER EVER book a holiday with Sunwing ever again!! you guys don’t know what customer service is!"

My boyfriend and I booked an all inclusive trip to Mexico leaving May 5th, scheduled to arrive in Puerto Vallarta at 11pm. They just informed us they have changed our flight to now arrive at 3am, and also our hotel booking so we don’t get our room until check in at 3pm the next day. This means we will  be at the hotel for close to 12 hours before getting a room, and will also be there around 4am with no room, and when nothing is even open for breakfast. What are we supposed to do at the hotel between 4-7am with no room to sleep in? I understand that flights change, but at the very least they should ensure we have a room to go to if we get there in the middle of the night!! We called Sunwing to complain and they said there was nothing they could do, sure they could book us the room for that night but it would cost $150 extra on top of the package we already paid for. After this I will never be flying Sunwing again."

On one scale, they weighted my luggage as 6 lb and on another counter, they weight 6.6 while i reduce the weight on it already. Its a scam that is doing right now.

We submitted a form stating our complaint to the director of the company, until today (2 1/2 years  later we haven’t heard a single word from them). At that time I was 5 months pregnant and they did not have any seafood for us on board as usual. Neightehr did we have any food un us. So the 4-5 hour flight was an harrasment."

We arrived on time, and when we were there, we have been noticed the flight was delayed. Two hours later the flight departed but the boarding representative took us off the plane because it was supposed we lost the connection (to Brazil) in the same airline. They took us off the plane telling us that we should a hotel by ourselves, pay for it and we would be refunded (it wasn’t an airline representative, was somebody who wanted to help because she spoke in Portuguese). They left us in the Airport with no accommodation, no food, no explanations. The guys who work there on behalf of  Swiss told it is not their fault or responsibility because the only make the check-in but the not represent it."

The worst  experience ever. My flight out of Chicago was delayed , missed the connection in Zurich, I had to wait 6 hours plus one hour on the aircraft before take off.  when I complained online about the inconvenience it caused me (my mom passed away and I had someone picking me up at the VCE airport) the reply was basically -we are not part of the UE, u are on your own! The aircraft was small, not enough room for your legs. On my way back  the aircraft was bigger so it was fine and we left on time, but once  again the staff was quite impersonal. At arrival my luggage was  delayed. Customer service was useless. My luggage arrived 36 hours later at 5:45am."

After 20 minutes Swiss Air staff appeared but told me they could not help because they had to go home.  2.  I called customer service to get help but call center personnel seemed very unprofessional and poorly trained.  First, they asked me to walk over to a United counter to obtain assistance, but United agent said they could not work on Swiss Air tickets.  Second,  they kept me on hold for over 1 hour and gave me the incorrect rebooking information, stating  I could leave the next day at 4:00pm.

The website showed $460 for rebooking but did not allow me to proceed. I had to call customer service – took me 12 phone calls on international roaming over 5 hours to change a simple flight. They wanted to charge me 5-6 times the amount quoted and kept hanging up the call. My last call was 55 mins simply to push back the flight by a few hours. Despite telling the staff I’m on international call, she pit me on hold 15-20 mins at a time, i could hear her chatting and laughing to colleagues when I was on hold (she forgot to put the hold music on). I ended paying nearly $1000 on roaming fee, more than double what the original rebooking fee would have been, and wasted 5 hours as even when they said it has been sorted, no confirmation cane through for me to call back and found out nothing has been booked.

Called Swiss several times and each rep sent me to speak to someone else: 2 phone number where I was told to call back the airline, and one email address THAT DOESNT EXIST.

We arrived at the airport early where a very CORRUPT or INCOMPETENT check in staff member refused to supply boarding passes unless we completed paperwork that she in error thought would be needed 2 flights later.  This Swiss Air staff check said we could pay 20 Euro per person for someone to complete this paperwork or try to do it on line and refused us access to the Business Class lounge which has computers for us to do this paperwork.  We came close to missing our flight and had to run to the gate after we were paged.  I lodged a complaint with Swiss Air Lines and asked for 2 free Business Class Lounge passes because we could not use our passes and they refused.  They made a mistake in asking for unnecessary paperwork, we paid but were not allowed to use the Business Class lounge and we nearly missed our flight. Very unhappy regular flyers."

I always select my seats in advance, for which I am being charged £ 30. I don’t mind, because that gives me the opportunity to select the seat that I want. On at least 5 out of the 25 flights I was told either at the check-in or at the gate and once on the plane itself that my seat has been changed ‘for operational’ reasons, only to see somebody else seated in the seat that I have selected and paid for. I complained in writing that they should not charge me £ 30 for a seat that I did not select and not want and asked for a refund. Swiss refused a refund, although very clearly, I was paying for a service which they did not provide. I was assigned a seat by Swiss but I was being charged for ‘selecting’ a seat. I have had enough.

Afin d’être autonome, j’avais réservé en avril et en septembre une voiture par cartrawler, société qui figure sur le site Swiss. Naturellement, comme je n’ai pas volé, je n’ai pas utilisé une voiture. Cartrawler refuse de rembourser et les 700 euros environs de ces réservations sont pour ma pomme. Swiss me dit que cette société n’est pas un partenaire, mais je trouve un peu léger de laisser ces gens prélever de l’argent sans offrir de contrepartie. Je conseille de ne pas réserver sur le site de Swiss, mais allez directement sur les sites des locations de voiture. Vous n’aurez pas les mêmes difficultés que j’endure. Bon vol à tous !"

On the next flight, they closed the check-in because they gave about 150 tickets for a plane with 100 seats. Then, they disappeared. No answer to email and to claim. Nothing. I had to buy a flight with TAP to go back home. I never saw something like that in more than 20 years of travelling all around the world. Now, they delete comments in their facebook page to hide all the rage of the passengers in similar situation, every day! Local people not always write complains here, the real amount of passengers left without a flight is much higher than you might see. Do not fly with TACV for any reason. Don’t take the risk! An operator in Malpensa airport (Milan, Italy) told me that is the worst company operating in Milan."
Eve,"January 22, 2020",Tacv Cabo Verde Airlines,1.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,The first leg of the trip saw my son stranded in Cape Verde for over 14 hrs. His plane arrived late and staff left all passengers overnight with no announcements whatsoever. Also there was no entertainment or hot food served on this trans-Atlantic flight from DC! His return was rescheduled 3 times with a two day differential and the last two reschedules happening on the day of the flight. When he finally arrived at the airport he was told that Cabo Verde had changed his flight to another airline which had already departed. They never sent us notification of this change. We had to end up buying another ticket on another airline. The desk agent even went on to say that his original flight was not even one they had. It was a ghost flight. Never Again!
Jair,"February 8, 2017",Tacv Cabo Verde Airlines,1.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,2,No,"My fiance and I flew with TACV a few weeks ago and it was by far the worst airline we’ve ever traveled with! We paid over 1k for each ticket and clearly did not get our money’s worth. The seats were crammed and uncomfortable and there were no tv screens despite the long flight. The flight attendants were very assertive and rude. We were appalled by the bad customer service provided by this airline staff. I pressed the assistant light and asked one of the male attendants for some water and he rudely told me that I could go get it myself in the back of the aircraft!I was perplexed! Isn’t it their responsibility to assist the passengers and ensure their safety and avoid traffic in the isles of the aircraft? Another flight attendant roughly tapped the top of my fiance’s seat and rudely gestured for her to push her seat up so the passenger behind her could use his food tray. Not only does that  show the hostility of the airline staff, but also proves the lack of room since the food trays cannot be opened when the seat in front of you is reclined. To conclude this review, we would consider taking a boat next time we visit Cape Verde as opposed to flying with TACV airlines."
christopher,"November 2, 2016",Tacv Cabo Verde Airlines,1.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,0,0,0,,,0,No,I booked my flights for January 2017 between Praia and Maio in June 2016. Without telling me they changed the schedule including the dates twice making it impossible for me to make my connections. It’s a good job that for some reason I checked recently. As I was trying to sort out my other flights to fit they changed the schedule again. This was the last straw and I cancelled the booking asking for a refund. That was two weeks ago and no refund has arrived. When I chased them up I was told they’d do it “soonest” whatever that means. Be aware that if you book with them you are likely to have real problems. It’s not really surprising that they’re broke. It was rumoured that the Canary Islands airline Binter would be taking them over but it seems that the Cape Verde government have blocked it. They’d rather see their hopeless airline go bust than lose face it seems. It’s such a shame that such a wonderful part of the world that could have a thriving tourist economy is being ruined by such a dreadful airline.
Helio,"January 5, 2016",Tacv Cabo Verde Airlines,1.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,4,No,"I have use TACV in several occasions and the airline get’s worst by day. The customer service is horrible except for the flight attendant. In addition to the exorbitant rate they charge for the tickets, in most cases the employees steal from your luggage’s."
Pia,"June 24, 2015",Tacv Cabo Verde Airlines,1.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,3,1,,,1,No,"Worst ever. I agree with Maria who used TACV in 2014. It hasn’t changed since. We had the same experience. Never ever travel to Cabo Verde with this company. You will only be disappointed because you will never make your next flight unless you have more than 3 days in between. We have lost a lot of money because we didn’t make it to the next flight which we had to book again, hotelrooms we didn’t use and we had to book again because on top of it all they got us to miss the flight the day after, after informing us different. The holiday startet nice but it ended as a disaster. Never ever book with this company. Take another company if you really want to visit these islands or don’t if you have a lot of time. Even the taxidriver I talked to wouldn’t use this company if he would be able to pay it."
Maria,"April 3, 2014",Tacv Cabo Verde Airlines,1.8,Flew Economy,0.0,4,3,3,1,,,2,No,"I would like to let everyone know how TACV treated us during our trip. On Friday the 21st of February, the day we were supposed to leave to go to Cape Verde, we didn’t. After arriving to Logan Airport in Boston, we checked in and were then notified to return the next day at 7am to catch our flight to Cape Verde due to mechanical problems. The plane needed to wait for a part to come in from Florida. We ended up staying in a hotel in Chelsea, MA but while still at the airport getting more information on our flight, a lady told her fellow workers that they shouldn’t be telling any other passengers about the free hotel vaulter and they should just tell everyone to go back home. On Saturday, we arrived at Logan Airport at 7am just like we were told and waited until 9am to board. We boarded sometime around 9 to 9:30 and didn’t leave until 10:15. The airplane ended up waiting for people who were late. Saturday night, we arrived in Praia around 9pm Cape Verde time, and were then told that since we missed our flight the day before, we would have to wait until the next day because the plane can’t land in Beila at night. On Sunday, we arrived back at the airport in Praia and caught our flight to Beila after 1pm. We arrived safely to our family and had an amazing time with them. Sadly, our 6 day vacation was cut short and we weren’t able to do everything we had planned. On Thursday the 27th, the day we were supposed to catch our flight home, we missed it because we were late. The boarding time on our boarding pass said 9:30am and the departure time said 1pm. My aunts and I needed to see our grandmother in the hospital before we left so we went to see her. We were back inside the airport before 12:30pm that day and everyone kept telling us to run before we missed our flight. All 3 of us ran as fast as we could. We got our passports stamped, went through security and got to the doors where we would just go through in order to get on the airplane. We were then notified by the TACV staff that we couldn’t get on the plane. The doors were wide open and the stairs were on the plane. 15 minutes later, the stairs were removed and we watched the plane take off. During those 15 minutes I’m sure we would of had the chance to board. The TACV staff told us that they would send out one of the guys to tell the pilot that we had arrived but instead they just stood there and did nothing. Another lady told us that she would get our luggage off the flight, but instead of following through with what they said, they all stood there doing nothing. There were at least 9 of them there just laughing and telling us to return next Thursday. I cried. I should of been let on the plane. I had nothing. I missed school the next day. And I didn’t even had a toothbrush to brush my teeth, elastics for my braces, my hand brace for my broken hand, or even my glasses so I could see. I had nothing! This is not how I was expected to be treated on my trip to Cape Verde. If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have taken those days off of school to struggle. On that same Thursday, my whole family struggled. All we wanted was a flight home and yet we got nothing. Running from one TACV place to another, we accomplished nothing. None of them helped us in any way. All they did was tell me to stop crying. One guy wouldn’t even talk to us after we waited 5 hours to talk to him. His wife even told him that we were waiting for him but he told us that she never told him anything. He was in a rush to go to a meeting and didn’t even acknowledge the fact that we were there. He didn’t care about what happened. None of then did. That same day, we went to the airport in Praia again to see if we could catch the 2:30am flight on Friday morning to Portugal then from Portugal to back home. We were trying our best to see if they would help is pay for our flight but they told us they couldn’t, knowing that we had no money! We tried every way we could to book a flight for that morning but we couldn’t. It just felt like we were stuck on the island and couldn’t get off. On Saturday, we took TACV from Praia to Sal then from Sal to Portugal. We waited for 5 people at Sal and I’m not even sure if they ever got on the plane. This caused us to be over an hour late and to almost miss our flight to Portugal. On Sunday, we waited for 1 person to board before taking SATA to arrive home in Boston. This vacation was a big disaster and I do not plan to ever take TACV to Cape Verde ever again!"

I’ve been trying for 8 months and I still get the same email reply from them. Of course our flight the next day was delayed hours causing us to miss our connection in Lisbon. Zero luck getting reimbursed on that as well. Don’t expect any reimbursements from these people. It’s amazing they’re still flying. I’ve seen my comments repeated often times in these reviews of TAP.

I do not remember a meal. The seats were uncomfortable compared to American, Delta, British Airways, etc. I gave them another chance last year fling from Miami to Lisbon in Business Class (This replaces First Class). This was a whole new world. I had a one seat to bed so I did not have a fellow passenger next to me. Great entertainment choices on a quality screen and headphones. I was served a appetizer, salad, main course and dessert along with wine. The food was fresh, tasted great and was as good as any of the other airlines. The seat bed/bed was very comfortable. My only negative comments: They were late taking off from Miami so I missed my prepaid van service to the cruise hotel. The staff did not follow up to check on refill of drinks or any other passenger requests. They did promptly comply if you walked up to their area in the front of the plain."

They said to ask on the plane. We asked about the meal on the plane. They said they didn’t have it, sorry. At the end of the flight, they realized that they did have the meal, they just had a miscommunication. We submitted a ticket after the flight and got the most useless reply. It said they “apologize for the inconvenience caused”, “place the highest value on our Passengers”, and also that there’s nothing they can do. At the end of the day, I really don’t care about the meal. But as you can see, they do not give a crap about you.

I submitted a formal complaint at the airport and another complaint online on the airline website, but there is no answer, no call, no email to give an update on my bag with my belongings, not a customer service agent to call about the lost baggage online form to fill as complaints."
Florian,"September 22, 2020",Tap Portugal,3.7,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,2,2,1,1,2,3,No,"Cleaness of the airplane in the business class from Lissabon to Sal early this year was mediocre at best. Arriving in Sal the airline had “forgotten” all our luggage in Lissabon. No airline representative available, had to pick-up my luggage 24 hours later around midnight. Even after hours in the phone line no refunds, emails are only replied  to after weeks. Even considering COVID the airline is significantly below standard and should not be in Star Alliance."

They changed my flight three times, twice within a few days of takeoff, and made it physically impossible for me to make a connecting – they switched my connecting airport, giving me a four hour layover in which I had to transfer from Lisbon to Porto (an over three hour journey that is also expensive). It would have been impossible to make my flight."

In addition, they gave us seats 9 rows far from each other! The airplane was overloaded, it was really not a safe flight and we didn’t even find a place to put our handbag; the food is very disgusting, we couldn’t eat it. And I also have to mention that it was delayed in both ways for minimum 40 minutes. In conclusion, it’s surely the worst airline you may ever fly with."

When we arrived at  Otopeni airport we realized that the flight to cyprus left an hour ago. They basically booked us on a flight that was impossible to get as we were late. It took us 45 min to find a member of staff from Tarom and when we did it was impossible to communicate and understand each other. It took the member of staff 30 min to speak with a manager and when she finally did she said that we have to go to the ticketing office and speak to the manager. On our arrival there there was no manager. Just a very rude ticket officer repeating the word “fuck” about a hundred times. They told us that they called a taxi to take us to a hotel something that wasnt mentioned to us before and to behonest never agreed to. They other choices they gave was connection flights with a duration of 8-9 hour for the next day. Although the was another airline flying to cyprus an hour and a half later they refused to pay for our ticket. We had to pay another ticket to fly home as we had to attend work in the morning.

I had check in and drop luggage by 17:30. And at the time of the boarding I had to visit the ladies room. So, your airlines didn’t announce my name on the loudspeaker and the aiplane just left without me. When I go to your desk on the Otopeni airport the employee laught with the situation and he didn’t try to help me. Furthermore, I went to the lost and found and my luggage was traveling to Athens without me (I am informed that this is prohibited). So after the land of this flight I went again on the desk and there was another employee (woman this time) that tell that she cannot know where is my luggage. Her behaviour was unacceptable she was screaming at me that this is not her job , she even tell me  that if I don’t leave from her desk she will call the police.

Both planes were very comfortable. There was no difference in the seat size between business and economy on the A318 (the main difference is that the middle seat is blocked), but the 737-700 had larger business class seats, with the tray table in the side so as to separate each seat. I sat in a bulkhead seat, which also had the tray table on the side, but I didn’t feel like the seat size was limited as much as it is on KLM bulkhead and exit row seats. I had plenty of legroom, especially because I was on an aisle and could stretch my legs to the fullest. I ordered a low calorie meal, which was delicious. I really liked the packaging that the food comes in – the dual purpose of it being a garbage bag is industry leading! The wine was decent, I was glad they offered it on a complimentary basis. There was no tv entertainment on a 3 hour flight, which was a bit annoying, but, all in all, a positive experience."

The pilots are amazing and they were trained in a great way. Landings are always perfect, one can nearly feel a little shake when touching down and sometimes you just don’t realize you’ve landed. That’s how smooth Tarom’s landings are. Departures and arrivals were always on time, no delays whatsoever when I flew with them. The planes, especially the A318s, are comfortable, clean and well taken care of. Tarom will always be my first choice when traveling somewhere."

My bag took slight damage on the BKK to FRA leg.  The in flight entertainment was better than good but not good enough for me to rate as excellent.  The international selection of movies and the smooth jazz channel are two options I’d rate very highly.  Overall I think THAI Airways gave really good service.  Crew were pleasant and efficient.  They regularly moved up and down the aisles with Coke, juice and water.  Meals were very good on all flights.  I’d fly with THAI again."

Preferred the old 747’s but the planes were so old and the 777’s have better in flight entertainment.  Seat room is very tight especially if seat in front reclines. After boarding, the plane was so hot inside,everyone was fanning themselves with any paper they could find. After about an hour after take off crew finally got the cabin temp cooler. No individual vents on this plane. Food was terrible. Most passengers that I could see left most of their food. Check in was good at BKK No hot/cold towels on plane anymore.

In all they were OK, nothing extraordinary but nothing terrible either. They do insist it’s safer to hold your child than use an infant seatbelt, which seems strange & at odds with other airlines. When booking we requested more room since we were travelling with a toddler on our laps, & thankfully were given a bulkhead row. They also offered to hold the 3rd seat free if space permitted. This sounded too good to be true & was, as on 3 of the 4 legs the seat was filled. This was a bit disappointing as they seemed to just give the seat away willy-nilly to anyone who asked for it without any reason (anyone who has travelled with a toddler knows it’s truly justified!). There was also a very loud passenger sitting elsewhere who several times came and stood in the isle to talk to a passenger behind us. He was intoxicated, very loud & disruptive, ultimately waking me and my baby (and the 20 or so surrounding passengers). Whilst not directly Thai Airway’s responsibility, is was a right old pain since it’s hard enough to get a baby to sleep on a plane, let alone sleep yourself."

The only thing they can offer was a “full refund” and book another tickets with another airlines if you really wanted to be in phuket as you follow your  itinerary (which will cost you double from original price).

Kati,"January 19, 2019",Thai Lion Air,3.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,"Thai Lion Air is full of a bunch of con artists. In January, 2019, my husband and I were taking a very short flight from Krabi to Bangkok in Thailand. This is about a 50 minute flight. This was part of our three week journey through Southeast Asia and we had booked the flight long before we began our trip. People had warned me in advance about the high cost of overweight baggage so I made sure to look into this in advance. Thai Lion Air allows 10 KG of free baggage but I knew we would have more than that since we were traveling for so long. I booked the tickets online and paid with our US credit card. Afterwords I got an email notifying us that if we were going to exceed the 10 KG of free baggage, we should pay in advance for the extra weight so that it would not be as expensive. We attempted to do that online but it wouldn’t except the credit card (the same credit card we had just used to book the flight). We then called customer service and attempted to pay for the added weight with them, but they also told us they could not except US credit cards. They told us that we could pay for the extra baggage weight the day of the flight. That made me nervous so I looked online at their website and it showed that we could pay for an extra 15 KG for 520 baht (which is about $16 USD). I figured that wasn’t the end of the world so didn’t worry about it. When we got to the airport for our flight, they wanted to charge us 4400 baht (or $138 USD) which is twice the amount that we paid for the actual flight tickets! We argued with the woman and she brought over her manager who confirmed that it would be 4400 baht because we didn’t come to the airport to pay at least four hours in advance. The funny thing is, they don’t open until four hours before the flight so there is no way we could have paid more than four hours in advance. Basically, if you have a US credit card, there is no way you can avoid paying overweight baggage fees unless you just keep your weight below 10 KG. This airline is a bunch of con artists and I will never fly them again!"

We arrived just on time after waiting and extra 45 min in Don Muang (for a ontime plane)  Horrendous check in lines (took more than 40 minutes).

Ron,"September 4, 2018",Thai Smile,4.4,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,3,4,0,,,3,No,"Bangkok-Chiang Mai. Flight was on an A320. I had pre-selected my seat for this domestic flight, an aisle seat about 1/3 of the way down the aircraft. I think I chose Thai Smile because it was marginally cheaper than a Thai Airways flight around the same time (but only because I bought the ticket from Thai Smile’s own website (Thaismileair.com) which is normally much cheaper than the same ticket bought from the website of the parent company, Thai Airways). Refreshment on this evening flight was a sandwich made of blue bread with a kind of processed savoury-sweet filling which I am unable to describe. I’m assuming the bread colour was blue for some festive reason which I was unaware of, because with few exceptions blue is a turn-off in food presentation. The Thai Smile refreshment pack was way more beautiful and ornate than the food, and opened up to reveal said sandwich, napkins, a small bottle of water, etc. I noticed quite a few other passengers taking the packs home, unopened — but in my case and that of quite a few other passengers, reassembling the empty contents in the used pack was also useful for when the cabin crew were cleaning up. I had flown from Sydney and was able to use the international-domestic transfer facility in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi (BKK) because my incoming flight was Thai Smile’s parent company, Thai Airways, the only airline that Thai Smile has an interline agreement with, to the best of my knowledge. On a previous flight, I had flown from Melbourne to BKK on Royal Brunei with only hand luggage, but was told I couldn’t use the international-domestic transfer area, because ‘even if your Thai Smile ticket to Chiang Mai has a TG (Thai Airways) flight number, there is no interline agreement between your airline and Thai Smile.’ I had to go all the way back through immigration and customs, check in land side and come back through security again. So if using this airline to connect from an incoming international flight, and that incoming flight is not Thai Airways or Thai Smile itself, you need to allow time to go through the whole procedure of immigration, customs, check in, security — I think you should allow at least two hours, preferably three, depending on how busy the airport is likely to be at your time of arrival. I cannot comment on how quick bags were delivered to the carousels, because on this flight I only had hand luggage. The flight was more or less on time for both departure and landing. There is a lot of competition on this route, four airlines flying between Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi) and Chiang Mai, and even more low cost airlines flying the nearby Bangkok (Don Muang) – Chiang Mai route. Next time, if possible, I’ll fly this route on Thai Airways (more comfortable wide-bodied planes), rather than Thai Smile, or Bangkok Airways because for much the same price (maybe B100 or B200 more) Bangkok Airways provides all passengers with a departure lounge offering snacks, drinks, and free wifi, none of which Thai Smile offers. If connecting to/from international flights, both Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways also seem to have more interline agreements which can make a huge difference when navigating Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi)."
Borys,"April 26, 2018",Thai Smile,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,0,0,0,,,0,No,"On the 6th of april I had a flight WE591 from Siem Reap to Bangkok. But I did fly because a man at check in did not give me a boarding pass. He asked me to show him the return ticket, I produced it. Then he asked to show him 650 usd in cash. I told that money were on my debet card but he requested to withdraw them at ATM. Even Thai immigration never asked me to do it… I simply bought a new ticket at Air Asia and received my boarding pass with no additional silly requirements. It seems I will never try to fly Thai smile…"
Ian,"May 24, 2017",Thai Smile,4.4,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,0,,,3,Yes,Flew Bangkok to Chiang mai return. 3 of us in the party. Check in staff were great in both airports and the cabin crews were a breath of fresh air. What a pleasure to fly with an air line whose staff so obviously enjoy their work. Clean modern airbus. Plenty leg room. Have awarded the in flight snack a score of 3 as there is not a lot you can say about a sandwich. It was very nice and free. Overall a pleasure to fly with Thai smile.
Alex,"April 4, 2017",Thai Smile,4.4,Flew Economy,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Worst airline I have ever used. Avoid at all costs.  Missed my connecting flight due to this airline, was told my expense would be covered once I arrived at destination, were greeted by staff once we got to airport and told that flight was all booked and paid for, once we got to check in, was informed that no reservations were made and staff members were nowhere to be found . Compelety flabbergasted as to the negligence of this company. Worst airline ever."
Maria,"September 21, 2016",Thai Smile,4.4,Flew Economy,10.0,5,4,5,5,,,5,Yes,The best budget airline I’ve ever flown with. Excellent service.

On the way to Bangkok the staff at the front desk wanted me to pay my “overweight” even though I had below 30 kg. I wonder how she couldn’t see my baggage allowance on the computer and how she could have acted like she has never heard about Smiles Plus ticket! In addition, she was extremely rude! After unpleasant 15 min, and after her calling someone on the phone, she took my suitcase without even saying she’s sorry. But, that was a minor issue."
Gerald,"May 22, 2019",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,1,3,0,,4,3,No,Flew to Cyprus. Drunk party of people let on plane. Noise for 5 hours! Crew refused to sell more drinks. Loud and abusive. I thought it was illegal to let drunks on a plane.  Complained to T Cook. Apologised and said they would retrain crew. We also had our flight changed and were on a different plane so didn’t get legroom seats we paid for. They ignored this in the reply. We paid for a service we didn’t receive. No compensation for money lost. Poor customer service. Won’t use again.
Simone,"December 2, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"This was a RT between Boston and Manchester. I was supposed to make a connection at JFK on a Jet Blue flight back to Boston. Upon checking in at the Manchester counter, I was not issued a ticket for the Jet Blue flight. The Thomas Cook flight out of Manchester was delayed for over an hour. Communications about the delay were very poor despite repeated attempts by multiple passengers requesting updates about the departure time. Due to the delay, my connection at JFK was tight but still manageable had Jet Blue been able to issue me a ticket. Unfortunately, JB can’t even locate me on the passenger list. Thomas Cook obviously had the information about the connection, judging by the sticker on my luggage. But the information was not communicated to Jet Blue. I had to purchase a ticket ($400+) from JFK to Bos. I contacted Thomas Cook and was directed to email my complaint. It didn’t even have the courtesy to respond after 3 months. Unless you want a travel nightmare, don’t fly Thomas Cook. There’s no service to speak of, nor does it care to rectify its mistakes."
Karen,"November 13, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy Class,2.0,3,4,0,3,,,3,No,"Two family trips to Orlando, but 12 years apart. It took that long to have the confidence to use Thomas Cook again. In 2005, we were delayed for over 24 hours – not ideal when you have children aged 6 years, 3 years and 12 months. Admittedly, they did not leave us as long this time – just 5 hours. However, we were shabbily treated – no complimentary food or drink, lack of information and being rudely maneuvered around the departure gates. I did contact them, but of course they had an exceptional circumstance – airport congestion. I went ahead with using an adjudicator and guess what – it was NOW a lightning strike and airport congestion that pushed the delay over 3 hours. Lets forget about the fact they failed to get the plane to Stansted on time due to overrunning with maintenance which would have pushed the new departure time back by 3 hrs 10 mins. The use of extraordinary circumstances won the day and they won the case!! Definitely will not use this unscrupulous company again and cannot recommend them."
S,"September 28, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy Class,4.0,3,3,5,1,,,3,No,"I did not prebook as it would have been 24 hours to book and print out boarding passes if you hadn’t payed to prebook and I will not add any extra’s to a package holiday (it should be included in my opinion) The flight over to my holiday from Cardiff my husband and I were offered seats 8 rows apart, we requested to sit together even if opposite the aisle but apparently none were available. Returning from Tenerife at the check in desk my husband again asked if we could sit together this time we were given seats 5 rows apart. When the airplane was ready for take off I looked across from my seat and the seat directly opposite was free. Once the plane reached altitude I asked the steward if my husband could change seats, which he did. It seems to me that the ground staff on the check in desks just made it as awkward as possible because we hadn’t paid to have our seat allocated. I have flown with other airlines on package holidays and not paid to prebook seats and they still place us together. I was not best pleased all of this has put me off booking another package holiday with Thomas Cook. This was the first time in 10 years that I had done so"
Anna,"September 9, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,3,,,2,No,"Dear Thomas Cook, I’m taking the time to express my sincere disappointment with your staff, service and airline during our flight from and to London Gatwick. I haven’t in the past ever felt the need to spend my time writing a formal complaint but I guess it’s a good use of my flight time as flying with Thomas Cook has been a worse experience than any other airline I’ve flown with previously. Our flight (..flight number.) from London Gatwick to Dalaman began with an incredibly rude and bad wishing assistant at the check in desk. We were unaware that hand luggage allowance with Thomas Cook is less then any other airline at 6kg. For someone that flies over 10 times a year for both personal and business reasons a 10kg hand luggage has always been standard with other airlines and there has never been any issue. However we decided that as this is the regulation we will re-pack bags in order to be at the 6kg and try not to let the nasty assistant ruin the beginning of a holiday. Once we got to the boarding desk we find out that she’s actually flagged our names on the system to be weighed again (clearly has hands on her time to not trust customers). This was completely unnecessary and if anything just an action on her part to try and make our life more difficult. I regret not noting down her name but at the time I let it go and thought we were just unlucky with the person and didn’t take it as a reflection on the airline. Anyway regardless we’d laughed of the rudeness and lack of customer service and boarded our uncomfortable flight with absolutely no legroom or assistance. During our holiday we made sure to buy a hold baggage to fill and check in on the way back to avoid all the hassle with the hand luggage. The night before our flight back (….flight number) we went to check in online (which wouldn’t work due to errors with the Thomas Cook website) and pay for one item of hold luggage. The website allowed us to do this so we entered our payment method and received a confirmation of our 20kg checked in baggage allowance (a page we later on regretted not screen shotting but was not expecting any issues). Once at the airport in Dalaman waiting over 30mins in the check in queue arriving at 12 with a hand and hold luggage in tow we get to check in desk 7 to find out our seats were automatically allocated and cannot be changed. As we had two 6ft7′ men we’d asked if we can change the seats to exit rows due to the leg room required (a small request every other airline always accommodates and understands). Thomas Cook did not. Apparently seats are allocated and cannot be moved even if the person in the exit row doesn’t need or want it, people that need it cannot have it. Computer says no basically. Anyway accepting another flaw in the TC system we come to the biggest con I’ve ever seen an airline do to its customers… We find out we don’t actually have a paid for hold luggage! Despite allowing us to book one during the check in process for £25 it was actually afterwards declined by Thomas Cook due to the policy of not being able to get hold luggage within 24 hours of the flight. Yet check in is only possible within 24 hours. A system clearly designed to catch people out and make them pay double the cost (£50) at the airport. As much as you want to create the illusion that there isn’t enough time for it to go through the system otherwise (which we all know is BS) it is purely because you know most people that would pay for a bag would do it as part of check in. After all no one wants to go on the airline website more than once during their holiday time or is thinking about their flight home until check in, which you take advantage of to make more money. So I’d like to highlight 2 very unhelpful, unconcerned and rude individuals; David Nelson and Victoria Richardson. The only 2 Thomas Cook representatives on site apparently and the most senior roles present. They did absolutely nothing to help and offered no alternative other than to complain to someone that can actually help online to get the £50 refunded. I truly hope this is the least compensation that’s offered as none of the troubles we went through were at a fault of our own. To continue, we went to pay the £50 but they told us they don’t take card! Again clearly a rip off tactic as most people spend their foreign currency prior to getting their flight home. So we had to find the nearest cash point, get money out (obviously this could only be the local currency in Turkey and not pounds) which we were charged for. So we go to pay in lira when we realise we’re being charged more (250 lira vs £50) which by no exchange rate is equal amounts. So the woman behind the desk tells us to exchange the money to pounds at another desk for the better cost. We do exactly that where we should get £54 but they don’t give coins so we end up with £50 (again robbing us of cash). During all this, we receive absolutely no help or reassurance from any of the staff on site which is disappointing. Now I understand that the latter part is more due to the awful airport we were flying from but you’d expect as a customer of Thomas Cook to have some support or at least some customer service at hand but that was not the case sadly. Having paid over £300 for a short haul flight I was expecting you to be at the same standard as flights of a similar cost by other airlines. I can honestly say that I was shocked by the absolute 0 help we received and the attitude of trying to make our life harder and more unpleasant. I would honestly avoid ever flying with you again even if I got flights offered for free. It’s not worth the heartache, stress and surprises along the way, especially at the price we paid. I’ll be doing my best to relay this experience onto everyone I know to make sure no one else has to go through what we had. I now truly appreciate the likes of even budget airlines such as easy jet who provide helpful and friendly staff at a fraction of the cost. I seriously hope you acknowledge this complaint and are aware that you have lost 4 customers that will be doing a very high amount of flying in the future. And to think all it would have taken was friendly and helpful staff that recognise you did everything to follow their rules yet the airline systems still wouldn’t allow it is a shame. Possibly your brand mission is to con your customers and enjoy making their life difficult and you’re not bothered by return customers in which case I’d recommend to anyone that wants good service and a stress free experience to choose a different airline (and save yourselves some money even). Thanks"
Lee,"August 16, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,2,4,1,,,2,No,Worst transatlantic experience ever. Paid for everything on board bar two paltry and pretty poor meals – why or how James Martin put his name to it is difficult to comprehend – plus in flight entertainment was drop down screens or watch via their app on own device with much less battery time than the 9.5 hour flight I was on. Never had to pay for ALL drinks on a long haul flight before. Budget with a huge capital B; if you want to book it DO NOT Thomas Cook it. Wouldn’t fly with them again even if it was free.

The flight out was bad, but the flight home was horrendous.I paid 40 pounds extra for seats for my wife and myself,only to be subjected  to non stop bad behaviour from 3 children behind us,constantly  kicking the back of our seats,leaning over our seats and even standing up on there seats in mid flight.One child in the seat in front of my wife screamed NON STOP for nearly an hour.The parents did nothing along with the cabin crew who were too busy talking. An old woman beside me was on her way to a funeral,and told me she had never known anything like it. Total lack of duty from the cabin crew.I hope we dont have to fly with this company again.

Lorrane,"June 9, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"This is so far the worst airline that I had to deal with. They don’t honor their responsibilities as a carrier regarding missing luggage or flight delays. I was in a flight from Washington, DC to Amsterdam and had  two connections: one in Boston and one in Manchester, UK. The flight from Washington, DC to Boston was delayed for two hours and because of that I missed the other flights. When I called Thomas Cook Airlines Costumer Service they told me there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait 4 days for the next flight. They refused relocating me in a different flight with a partner company, wanted me to stay in Boston for 3 nights and didn’t want to pay for my hotel. In the top of everything they lost my luggage and refused to accept the claim. I had to cancel my trip and lost my main personal belongings, which obviously they refuse to pay for. DON’T FLY WITH THIS COMPANY. It is not worth the headache!"

Andy,"March 17, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,3,1,,,0,No,"Disgusted with Thomas Cook Airlines. Used my cabin travel case for 8 years now. Never an issue size wise, even with Ryanair. It’s seems Thomas Cook airlines has an very small cabin bag size allowance. Conned me out of Â£100 (Ã‚Â£50 each way) to put it under. As you can see from the picture, they were REALLY struggling for space! Been a long time since I’ve felt. Left a VERY VERY VERY bad taste in terms of the brand. Be a very longtime before I ever book with Thomas Cook again. Jet2 for me moving forward. At least they do not con you."
Raymond,"March 4, 2017",Thomas Cook Airlines (Group),4.1,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,5,2,,,4,No,"Total waste of time. Ryan Air is luxury compared to this cowboy outfit. I don’t have enough letters to describe how sad this airline is in every respect. Tried to upgrade to Premium Economy on a flight to Goa from Gatwick and was told that there was no PE seats on that flight. An absolute out and out lie. Couldn’t believe it when boarding the plane that there were seven rows of PE seats. Have spent over fourth pounds on mobile phone in Goa trying to upgrade to PE on the way back only to be told I can’t change the booking once the flight has taken off. What a load of rubbish. The customer service is beyond useless, are totally ignorant of what the airline has to offer and are so far up themselves to be bothered to find out. Would never again contemplate flying with Thomas Cook. The negative reviews on this site do not come close to describing how gross this airline is. I won’t even begin to describe our seats on the flight to Goa and we paid an extra Ã‚Â£60 for better seats. I am so incensed about our treatment by this third rate carrier it is unbelievable."

B,"December 21, 2017",Transavia,4.0,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,0,,,0,No,"The worst flight experience I have ever had. I will never fly Transavia again. Never. The aircraft was delayed twice. Once outbound on the 14/12/2017 from Dublin to Paris and again on the inbound flight on the 17/12/2017. That would be peculiar but entirely acceptable. But that is just where the nightmares began… I arrived at the outbound gate on time on the 14th but with a large crowd of people in front of me, sitting in the waiting area at the appropriate gate. Then at about 7 minutes before the official closing of the gate the crowd which started to queue, suddenly turned around and started to walk and run up the length of the terminal. They and I included, en masse, moved in a panic about 100 meters to a new gate. No explanations, no announcement. Jaw dropping. I’m sure to other airport users their first thought was bomb scare. Then guess what? The official boarding time came and went. About 15 minutes later and after one of my fellow passengers complained one of the Transavia staff (ticket agents, airport staff?) made a quick and curt announcement that the flight was delayed. This means if you arrived late or after the official boarding time to the original gate you would have thought the flight was gone. There was no intercom flight announcement of a gate change. And as far as I could see no Transavia staff posted throughout the terminal with placards for any late comers…Then a further wait. The flight was one hour late taking off. No formal apology. No explanation why. Bizarre in the extreme. But then on the flight back again, the flight was delayed; out of “the” worst airport on the planet, Paris Orly South. Again no formal explanation and no apology. The queue for the gate (gate 27) at Orly hell hole was merged with 29 with the moving walkway propelling people to skip the queue. Bottomline this flight was about 40 minutes behind time. The staff in Dublin and Orly were rude, curt, unhelpful with one or two of them in Orly just plain nasty. The whole experience was similar to what cattle must sense when they are herded into a pen before being sent to slaughter. It was that intense with zero respect, compassion or consideration. The worst experience I have ever had with an “airline.” Never again. Avoid Transavia and Orly South like the plague!!!"
Jenna,"July 18, 2017",Transavia,4.0,Flew Economy,4.0,3,4,1,1,,,0,No,"I flew Transavia from Paris to Madrid. Once I got to the gate, the desk people told me and other members of my group that they will have to check our carry on bags since there is no room in the cabin for them. We all said okay and they  put the luggage tags on them. I ask the desk if its okay that I can bring my handbag onto the plane since I would have my carry on. I was told that is perfectly fine.  Fast forward, in line got my ticket check about to walk onto the plane.  A man in a green vest(the colours and logan of transavia, he worked for the company, or just that plane/airport)  He than began to ask me repeatedly  to put my handbag into my carry on. I told him that the desk people were putting my carry on onto the hoof( where the big suitcases go) and that I was told that it was okay for my handbag. He then kept telling me I had to put my handbag into my case or pay 30 euros. he started to take my carry on away and I called him to bring it back and not take it from me. He kept saying and I kept explaining until his supervisor came and told him I could bring my handbag . This happened to all my group members.

I would never spend a dime on this ever again. The good part about this story; we got 2 15 euro vouchers!!!

No more explanation given and no food/water provided. We then almost took off until an alarm went off due to the engine issues. At this point (3 hours later, almost midnight now) everyone felt unsafe and just wanted to be let off the plane. Just don’t do it.

At the gate I was told that my bag didn’t fit in the cabin because it was to big to fit under the seat and the compartments above the seats were already filled with bags from other passengers. I was the last missing passenger and I understand that a 737 passenger jet doesn’t have space for all those big bags in the cabin. They offerd to check in my bag for free at the gate and I could remove any important items out of the bag into the cabin. Although it’s a budget brand of KLM and AirFrance don’t expect that you can use your member card at Transavia for fast check-in or extra services. They have there own policy, you can use you member card to collect air miles though! The flight was good and smooth, the aircraft seemed to be a brand new one so that might helped. The crew did there job, friendly Dutch or English speaking crew with humor. Because it’s a low cost airline beverages aren’t included but drinks and snacks are reasonably priced. I felt welcome, save and comfortable onboard there aircraft during my flight to Dubai."
shannon,"November 7, 2015",Transavia,4.0,Flew Economy,4.0,2,4,3,0,,,4,No,"Transavia, is hands-down THEE worst airline I have ever flown (and I’ve flown in Cambodia)! BEWARE! The people at the check-in aren’t even aware that they work for a subsidiary of AirFrance/KLM. I presented my AF frequent flyer card, and the woman says “Sorry, this is Transavia, not AirFrance”. And they absolutely DO NOT have enough space for every passenger to bring one VERY legal-sized carry on. Mine was a $300 Samsonite that is a regulatory bag for carry-on; which is WHY I bought it from a Samsonite dealer!!! It weighed 6 kilos total, and I had to check it! So they randomly walk through the waiting gate and say “OH, OH, OH, you have to check that BIG bag! BUT hey it’s for free, so aren’t you lucky!” So, flyers beware… my advice, hide your bag when you’re at the gate under the chairs, or they will force you to check it. I think they have a quota, “check 25% of the passengers’ carry-ons… because we really do NOT have room for one carry-on per person”. Crappiest airline ever! Total liars. Seriously?? How can the employees not even be aware that they work for KLM/AirFrance???"

I have nothing but praise and thanks towards the staff of this airline as i received outstanding service whilst flying with them. I want to give a special thanks to Harpa, the Thompson rep at Tenerife as without her myself and my mum would not be home yet. When checking in to go home i needed to go to hospital and was unsure if i would make my flight home as the staff at the hospital were being very difficult, Harpa spoke to the staff at the hospital for us and as a result of this we were able to get back to the airport where Harper was waiting for us even though her shift had ended she came back to the airport to ensure that we had no difficulty in making our flight home. Harpa is a wonderful young woman and Thomson is extremely privileged to have such a dedicated, kind person on their staff. If i ever go back to Tenerife i hope that Harpa would be our rep again as she is outstanding and a great ambassador for your company!"
Jon,"April 11, 2016",Tui (Group),4.1,Flew Economy,9.0,4,5,4,5,,,4,Yes,"I flew with Thomson on one of their Dreamliners from Manchester to Jamaica return. Both flights were absolutely faultless. We were straight through check in and the flight was on time so had time to get some breakfast and a spot of duty free shopping before boarding. I have never had as much leg room as I did on this aircraft. It was very spacious. The crew couldn’t do enough for you and regularly came back with more drinks, to the point where he just walked passed and gave me a couple of beers when he saw I had finished. Great service. IFE was brilliant with a great selection of films. Was not bored once during the 10 hours. Would definitely fly again with Thomson."

Oh how 22 years had changed it all. Luton check in was an average experience but the flight to Corfu was a total let down.

A total let down from the hey day of Britannia and from what you could see all done in the name of PROFIT."

They weighed everyone’s carry on luggage and I got told mine was overweight so had to pay for my bag, I think it cost about 30 pounds for one way. I could not pay for the bag to be checked in on my return journey at that time. When in Mallorca I emailed them and asked If I could purchase a check in bag online. I couldn’t and I couldn’t do this over the phone either, only way was by purchasing again at the airport which obviously cost more and wasted my time as I had to go to a seperate desk to pay. The staff at the check in deals were all very rude. The seats were uncomfortable, the food was expensive and disgusting. Also a very bumpy flight and there was a problem with An oven that kept having this high pitched squealing sound, Someone complained but they didn’t seem to care"

ely,"January 18, 2016",Tui Fly Belgium,3.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,1,3,1,,,2,No,"One of the most unreliable airlines worldwide. My trip was from Brussels to Cancun with Jeairfly, and then Cancun/Mexico City with Volaris. They tell you schedule can change, so I booked the latest flight to Mexico City at 22:30, in order to avoid any delay problems. My original departure was at 9:50am but they wrote me an email 10 hours before, that the flight was going to at 15:00. It was to late to change my flight with Volaris to Mexico City, so I had to book a new one. And then at about 11:00am, 1 hr before check in, when I was at Brussel’s airport after a 3 hour trip from home  they changed it again to 18:45. So, I was about to lost the second flight to Mexico City. I finally booked a 3rd flight to mexico city. The worst thing about it is that jetairfly just says “It’s not our fault because it’s said in the contract”. So if you fly with them, you have a big chance that they’ll change times and you will loose a day of your vacation and all later connection flights. Jetairfly will avoid any kind of responsability and you will loose a lot of money. And, their prices went up 100% so it’s not so “low fare”."

Upon arriving to Tenerife Spain, 2 personal luggages of ours were missing. We reported and filed a missing/lost claim in Tenerife airport with a representative from TuiFly on the same flight. After 48 hours, we were forced to have to buy hygiene items, clothing, undergarments, pajamas, diapers, etc. because our baggage still had not arrived. One of our bags finally arrived on Wednesday, 13 July around 1800 hours. The suitcase was completely broken and our second piece of luggage was still not delivered. We have two small children (2 years old and 8 months old) and you can imagine how difficult it was to not have all of our belongings, to include our daughters medication and diapers, in addition to the our missing clothing and hygiene items. The first 5 days of our trip were completely overshadowed by our missing luggage. In addition to this, we repeatedly emailed TUI requesting updates and were left without a response.

Secondly, when I finally managed to write them, I got an answer after three days, when it was already too late to do anything. Than, their stupid system, which does not allow the passengers to do a self-check made me some  extra troubles at the airport, as I got a bit late for the check-in, due the fact that at that time there was some kind of parade in Brussels and some of the streets were closed, which delayed my arrival to the check-in at the airport.

We have tried calling a variety of countries Tunisair customer service numbers. Most never answer or even exist as a functioning phone number. We have been told that because we had the audacity to book directly with them online, they cannot help us and we must cancel by email. They have now canceled the flight themselves but refuse to make a refund, instead offering to make a multi leg  substitution on some other day.

On a flight of 1 hour and 30 minutes (Barcelona – Tunisia), they accumulated 3 hours of delay, and all for no apparent reason. The way these people work is being always late and flying when they please or can. It is not a serious company in any sense, and I absolutely do not recommend anyone to use it. In case it is essential to fly with them, I recommend a lot of patience and to keep all the tickets and documents that prove the delays or cancellations (that you will surely suffer), to be able to submit a claim."

They kept boucing us from one embarking point to the other. It was a big farce. So finally we got the right information from the personal that plane was delayed 5 hours @that point some passengers did ask for a claim form to present @ madrid airport because they lost their connection and the bullying started. I can tell u it wasn’t pretty to see from one side all passengers did regroup for a mutiny and from the other side the police slaming the embraking door telling us to go to hell. Long story short if you can avoid to take it please do.

Wish you could register without coming to their desk. Prices are ok,still would like to get some sort of snack or sandwich for their prices. Entertainment is not that good since they operate old versions of 737 so there is nothing except for safety card and a journal. From another point of view ,old 737 have softer seats (back in the days they didn’t save money on this). Plus safety should be good since this air company is licensed to do a D check of the plane ."

Anna,"April 2, 2018",Uia Ukraine International Airlines,4.5,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,"I was flying with UIA 4 times in total (in 3 of them destination was Kharkiv-Tel Aviv), in two of them I faced bad experience – which is 50%! The first time – in January 2017 – when I was flying from Kharkiv to Tel Aviv with one stop in Kiev – my baggage was lost during transit in Kiev, they found it after 3 days, but the bag was totally damaged and air company didn’t pay for this damage! I will not give here all details of UIA serves support, it was awful experience! Moreover the flight from Kiev to Tel Aviv was delayed by 2 h 50 min due to DAMAGE OF THE PLANE – as a pilot reported to us, we had to go out from the plane after sitting in it during one hour, than next 2 hours we were waiting for another plane. After this case it’s very difficult to believe in safety of planes which UIA uses. My second bad experience with UIA happened today – 29.03.2018 – during direct flight from Tel Aviv to Kharkiv. The flight was scheduled to be at 1.20am, the boarding was planned to be at 00.40-00.10, but actually it only started at 00.10. During 10 min VERY QUICKLY all passengers were already on board (personnel was pushing and stressing us to do everything quickly). At 00.50 the pilot said that Ben Gurion Airport already closed and we need to wait till 5 or 6am for the flight and they let us come back to airport from the plane. No food or compensations in this case were received! A few days before my relatives who were flying the same flight were in the same situation! If there is a risk for a delay WHY TO SCHEDULE THE FLIGHT IN THE LAST MINUTES OF THE AIRPORT WORKING HOURS?Why not to move the flight to 5-6am in general if it’s not the one exceptional case when UIA didn’t success to arrange the flight before airport closure? If UIA estimated risks accurately and wouldn’t arrange the flight when the risk of such a long delay is high – so many people wouldn’t waste the time and nights in airport! Very unprofessional planning! Moreover the price of the ticket I bought in economy class was $425 – includes luggage but doesn’t include food! And this is for 3 hours of flight! Is it a low cost?! In the end I want to add the reason why I was choosing UIA before and why I will never do it in future – ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONE MONOPOLY AIR COMPANY WHICH HAS DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM KHARKIV TO TEL-AVIV! But after my today’s trip I understood that flights of another air companies with one stop will be even more quick taking into account delay of UIA flight by more than 4 hours! I hope my feedback will help you to make a decision if to choose UIA or no. But my suggestion is – to avoid using UIA services!"

Nor did they informed that the ticket was in the category of no checked in luggage although the price was USD 300 for a two and half hour flight. They charged me additional USD 55 for one 7kg of luggage which had I been informed I could take to the cabin. I had liquids and could not do that. Moreover, my bag was damaged and the lock stolen. The ground service would not take a complaint. I appealed with their customer service, and a month later they informed that they were not responsible. Avoid these Soviet dinosaurs at all costs.

The Stuardesses were very polite and nice. I was upset, that i could drink only water for free, but i drank Wine anyways. The Embrayer Plane was OK… it wasn’t the one i wish me to fly with, but i booked a last minute ticket. There was not enough information about flying situation and where we are at the time or how high we are. Once they told it on the speaking box but it wasn’t understandable what they say. But anyway, the staff was pleasant. A flight to Vilnius from Kyiv was a nightmare, because that boeing was very old and I didn’t felt safe inside. I am 187cm high and my legs didn’t fit into my place where i was sitting. Close to me and around were 5 little children screaming and shouting all the time and I was in panic, because I was stressed of flying. Later the father of children sat next to me to control kids. The Staff was polite and nice to all of the guests. On nine of June i flown back to Vienna through Kiyv. Both with Embrayer. The flight was quite good and Staff was nice.

Bart,"April 22, 2017",Uia Ukraine International Airlines,4.5,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,We flew from Moldova to transfer in Ukraine and fly to Amsterdam as final destination. We been lied for 5 times about the time of departure. After 14hours of waiting we finally got to Kiev. We had to wait in Kiev for accomodation for another 2 hours. We paid 600 euro for the tickets and been treated like the dogs. THE WORST TRAVEL EXPERIENCE EVER.
Yuri,"January 28, 2017",Uia Ukraine International Airlines,4.5,Flew Economy,9.0,5,4,4,0,,,3,Yes,"I was flying Brussels-Kiev->Brussels. No entertainment, the food is very basic but an airplain is a mean of transportation, not a flying cinema or restaurant. The airfare was an excellent value for money and  the legroom surprisingly large for this airfare. The service onboard was good, the departure timing was very punctual. The only problem UIA has at the moment is the inconvenience caused by their IT infrastructure upgrade. Adding extra luggage and paying for it online was a headache. I hope they will fix this problem soon. Despite of this, I recommend this airline."

Flights are almost never delayed (I don’t count 10 min as a delay), stuff is okay, they are doing their job and it’s not to entertain smb. I am a satisfied customer and no other airlines can offer deals for me to fly to my family as they do."

However, our flight was cancelled due to technical problems on the aircraft.  As a result, we had an 10 hour lay over at the airport.  We had to wait for plane to arrive to Kiev from New York to fly us back to New York.  They did not offer any compensation for food during this delay.  There were many complaints  from several customers after sitting at the terminal for 3-4 hours with no water and/or snacks.  They finally brought food to make up for the inconvenience they’ve caused but they never apologized for this delay nor show any concern.  Needless to say that was an eye opening experience for many of us."

They confirm that yes i booked with united but air Canada is in star alliance united that is why i was scheduled with air canada. how is this my fault or problem, they decided to collaborate with air canada, they , why is it so hard to just connect with them and get my bags paid. Next thing i hear is i can only use the credit for united and mind you this credit has a deadline to be used else i loose it. So i either loose it or fly again with them.save your money and book with a better travel company"
Alan,"January 7, 2024",United Airlines,3.0,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,4,4,4,5,5,3,Yes,United does an excellent job of communicating via text during travel compared to their competitors. I find United to be a step above in class and customer service.

A plane was changed at SFO due to requiring serious maintenance, this caused hours of delay and the same happened at SFO on the return flight, even more hours delay. I was worried all the time in the air….would it stay there. Offered a grotty bag of crisps and small can of drink. The real winner was the strange sandwich given on the plane. I ask ‘are their planes safe,! Don’t want to fly on United again and they know that. So what am I offered, 7500 airmiles and $150 both to use on ‘United Airlines’. Bright people must run United!"

Boarded the plane headed to Chicago (Thursday night), sat for 30+ minutes at gate, then pilot announced a ‘mechanical problem’ we de-planed and queued up at gate to find out how United was going to get us home.  after an hour wait, we got to gate attendant who said they do not re-book at the gate, she gave us a hotel voucher (for one night) and told us to call the number on the business cards they had at the desk.  United was ZERO help in getting us home, much less quickly.  we were stranded in Montreal until Sunday morning, United has refused to reimburse us for the extra $1500 in expenses we were forced to pay for hotels (Friday/Saturday) and food for 7 for 3 days.

I can see an appreciable positive trend post-pandemic after the COVID cutbacks.  They still have NOT returned to the full CONSISTENT service of 2019. Technology, service both in air and on ground, and network are vastly improved. The United app is head and shoulders above ALL the airline apps in the world. United’s responsiveness to my needs during irregular operations has helped make up for food and consistency shortcomings.  Perhaps a status thing, but i’m as loyal as i have ever been."

All of my flights were delayed (one was because they had no crew), and apparently there is no in-flight entertainment offered anymore on United flights. There was no food offered other than a small bag of pretzels and a cup of water for a cross-country (5+ hour flight), I was forced to pay $10 for Wi-Fi service that didn’t work, and now I’ve been told United apparently have a new policy in which they don’t adjust fares for bereavement travel. When I called customer service, I was forced into using the text messaging option to try to resolve my concerns due to the waiting period to speak to a representative being over 90 minutes. The United representative that I texted with was not only not helpful, but their messages were full of poor grammar, no punctuation (they often wrote paragraphs with no commas or periods or anything…it was just a run-on, nonsensical way of communicating), and a complete lack of willingness to resolve my concern(s). United has lost a customer for life."

The last 4 flights have all been delayed, they don’t tell the truth, costumer service is horrible. Almost all there connecting flights are very tight, luggage didn’t make it on time, took 2 days for luggage to get to my hotel. On one flight out of Houston, they had two people checking bags for 4 flights at the same time. Using those kiosks cliche a lot, have to do everything yourself….. soon the passengers will be loading their own luggage on the plane and re-fueling the plane.. Avoid this mess"

Missed the first leg of my flight and gate staff refused to help me get booked in another flight from the same airport that would get me to my destination in time.  When I went to return home, found out United Airlines cancelled my reservation for the return flight without telling me.  They would only rebook me on a flight that arrived 11 hours late and would make me miss appointments, or charge me over $1000 more for a flight that got me back in a time frame that worked for me.  The supervisor at United was clearly more interested in spouting legalese than in providing quality customer service.  Ended up rebooking myself on a different airline and losing the cost of my ticket.  Will not fly with United again."

No other options were offered to me by the flight attendant. I did receive your typical airline food packet which was expected.  I never received any further beverage and the flight attendant wasn’t much interested in providing me any further services. The area was exceptionally dirty. It certainly had not been cleaned in some time. (debris, carpet, seat, and magazine rack I would rate as filthy) I had to get to a bathroom, as fast as I could, when I departed to wash my face and hands. I would have received all the same in coach and saved $250. I have been a loyal United customer forever. This was the most disgusting plane I have ever been on."

United did not respond to my calls or emails for over a year. This is how they treat their million mile fliers. They burry the issue and hope it would go away. They ignore loyal customers. To make matters worse I was pregnant at the time. There’s so much wrong here. It’s a shame it was an airlines I once loved and supported. There are so many other airlines, choose another one."
Anne,"April 1, 2023",United Airlines,3.0,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,2,2,1,0,No,"Disappointed time and time again. Customer service is also poor. My family and I have had most of our flights with UAL delayed or canceled, for often 2-3 hours, on the regular. They also admit it’s due to mechanical issues or waiting for staff, not weather-related. It’s become the exception if they fly on time (or nearly). We’ve missed huge family reunions, have incurred expenses, and the most they do for us is a $50 travel voucher that expires in a year. They have really gone downhill rapidly and I’ll avoid them as much as possible from now on.now what to do with their worthless travel vouchers…."
Karen,"March 4, 2023",United Airlines,3.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Weather in Houston delayed our flight from SAT to TYS. Unasked, we were put on another flight, which sat on the tarmac for 2 hrs until the pilot said the plane was overweight and asked volunteers to deplane. Eventually, enough passengers deplaned. Because of that delay, our flight from IAH to TYS was canceled and rescheduled for the next day. By then, it was 10 PM. I contacted United by phone while my daughter stood in the customer service line, which closed before she reached the front. The rep I spoke with said we could request cots to sleep in the airport or we could get our own hotel. We got a hotel. The new flight went from IAH to IAD, where we boarded for TYS via wet stairs from the tarmac. I wear leg braces and barely made it up, but when I did, the flight attendant rudely told me to go back down and gate check my backpack.  My daughter was able to take the backpack back down the stairs. United sent us each a $150 travel voucher; the last thing we want. We do not plan to EVER fly United again."

The aircraft were old (Ilyushin for the domestic flight, Boeing 757 for the international one) and for the eight hour flight only one of the three toilets in economy class was working properly. In-flight entertainment was a flashback to the 1990s, with fold-down mini screens above every 5 rows of seats and my headphones didn’t work. The flight from Tashkent to KL was daytime, yet many people wanted to sleep and put the blinds down; it was a very boring/uneventful flight. On the flight from Bukhara to Tashkent, the backrests weren’t strong enough and bent forward during braking after landing. You can fly Uzbek Airways to visit Uzbekistan or if it’s the cheapest/safest option, but I wouldn’t choose to fly it otherwise."

The airlines delayed the flight by 1day and send the update via email. The 1-day delay didn’t suit our plans, as all our bookings were already in place for the week. Hence we had no choice but to cancel it. As per the email,  if we cancel, we can get a refund only in the form of a Credit shell, which we can use later. However, this was of no use to us, as there were no other flights for the same day and we had to make another booking with another airline instead. Hence, we requested Viet jet to cancel and give us a full amount refund in our bank account directly. However, even post multiple emails and calls the airlines declined for the same and still insists on a credit shell."

At home I noticed more damage than I originally saw. My suitcase was cracked in 3 separate spots. When I opened the suitcase a bottle of sake I had was demolished. The sake leaked onto my watch and ruined my watch in the suitcase. I sent an email to simply inform them of how I was treated. I didn’t even ask for the $300 of damage that was caused. I got a return email saying they can’t help me because I didn’t submit a complaint at the airport. I replied to this saying I tried but their employee wouldn’t assist me. They replied with a copy and paste of their policies and procedures for damaged luggage.

I work in the travel industry in Australia and the communication with the staff has been awful. Slow to respond (if ever) and avoiding the refund of my tickets. The issue has been ongoing for 5 months now, before the Corona Virus was even a major issue. I booked online which in their policies, says you can get a refund. I normally am super positive and like to support the travel industry in as many ways possible, however my experience here has been nothing but terrible. The airline still holds $2600 of my money after acknowledging they would refund me. They are just delaying the process. Will not be recommending Vietnam Airlines to any of my clients travelling to Asia. They may have got $2600 out of me but they will lose so much more business moving forward due to the way they are handling their clients in times of crises. I was sympathetic and very patient with them, but now when I require a little bit back from them, even just an email of communication, it is ignored. Poor form VN."

First of all, they don’t provide baggage transfer if you are traveling joint fly. In my case it was Phu Quock – Ho Chi Minh – Singapore. Second and most important if you are traveling with somebody you can’t join your baggage limits. I have travelled with my wife from ho chi minh to Singapore, so we had 20+20kg baggage limit. Our baggage was 30 kg in one bag and they force us to split our one bag to two bags which weight don’t exceed 20kg.

JQ,"August 2, 2019",Vietnam Airlines,4.8,Flew Business Class,1.0,1,2,2,2,3,1,3,No,"The worse airline by far that we have flown with. They sent us a change of flight time TWO DAYS before departure (Singapore – Frankfurt) by 2.5 hours earlier! We do not live in Singapore therefore we naturally had pre-booked weeks before a different flight into Singapore, arriving at approx. 3 hours before our original connecting flight with Vietnam Airlines. The gap then didn’t allow for 2.5 hours of flight change time. Trying to contact VA by phone is a futile effort. Their automated phone system goes in a loop in Vietnamese. I then called up Singapore airport and asked to be transferred to Vietnam Airlines check in counter – Still didn’t get a hold of anyone. Singapore then suggested I contact them via FB chat. If I can gouge my eyes out it would have been less painful… They kept insisting that the flight time didn’t change even after I sent them screen shots after screen shots of email confirmation notification of change time. After 2.5/3 hours, they admit they did change the time. And the answer for that was – we are sorry for the inconvenience. No offer to cover the cost of our new flight. Unbelievable!"

Ngoc,"April 26, 2018",Vietnam Airlines,4.8,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,4,5,,,4,No,"A good airline operating mostly within Vietnam (domestic) and a limited number of international flights to China and Russia. Standards are good, good value. The staff is friendly and helpful. Good Food & Drinks served on flight. The In flight entertainment system is awesome and keeps you engaged all along. Excellent choices of movies old/new…"
Brian,"September 21, 2017",Vietnam Airlines,4.8,Flew Economy Class,2.0,1,3,2,3,,,3,No,"Booked a flight from Melbourne to Nha Trang, including a 3 hour stopover in Ho Chi Minh City for my wife and I through VN airlines. They change my flight schedule on 2 occasions shortly after purchasing my ticket, the second flight change reducing my stopover time to only 1 hour, and also including an email from VN Airlines ask me to change to a 5am flight the next morning with an offer to pay for 1 night accommodation in Ho Chi Minh City, which i decline as I have already booked accommodation at my destination (5-star resort at $350/night). I am also very concerned as I am transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight which requires me to clear customs, collect my bags and then check in again. VN Airlines leave my schedule as is and advise that they will have staff on arrival to assist with my transfer. When i arrive VN airlines take almost 1 hour just to unload our luggage – The staff member on the ground who was supposed to assist is glued to her phone texting the entire time. Once we have our bags she leads us to the domestic terminal, tells us we’ve missed our flight, shrugs our shoulders and then walks off, forcing us to stay 1 night at an old, run-down hotel (couldn’t even sleep due to the obscenely loud noises coming from the pipes in the walls) and forfeit the 1st night’s accommodation at our destination. I’ve attempted to contact their customer service line for compensation for weeks now, as well as included all my supporting documentation (emails, boarding passes etc.). Each time I do their response is always words to the effect of “someone will get back to you”, and then I never heard back. Completely disgusting."
Donald,"July 18, 2017",Vietnam Airlines,4.8,Flew Business,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,we travelled from melbourne to Ho Chi Minh on a daylight flight in business class the seats really good put to good use on flight home at night which I slept thru. The food on board really above the rest. Very clean almost new dreamliner with windows that you can change the tint on. We will fly again with them.
Barry,"June 20, 2017",Vietnam Airlines,4.8,Flew Economy,9.0,5,5,4,5,,,5,Yes,"It was a pleasant and comfortable flight depart from Kuala Lumpur (KLIA) to Seoul (Icheon) transit via Ho Chi Minh (Tan Son Nhat). Although there was a slight delay on the departure but the ground staffs manage to get every passenger on broad fast and efficient. Vietnam Airlines has proven themselves as a four star airlines with exceptional service provided. Friendly and efficient flight crews, good quality of food meals and equipped with latest new trendy A350 XWB aircraft! The aircraft ambiance was fascinating with larger screen and more leg room. The content selection was more than enough throughout the flight. This was my first time fly with VA and I’m quite impress with their product and services provided with that competitive price. May consider travel with VA again for long haul flights as their transit flight takes about 2 hour only. Thumbs up for VA."
Ross,"March 4, 2023",Vietravel Airlines,1.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,1,0,,1,0,No,"Terrible customer service. No operational customer support phone line. Inaccurate emails distributed with no remedy, despite showing their communication was filled with errors and misleading. Generally, a very embarrassing customer service standard. Would not use if possible."
Faina,"November 14, 2019",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Business Class,3.0,0,3,4,1,3,3,0,No,"I flew on Nov 1, 2019 from London to San Francisco flight VS19 in Upper Class cabin. Flight had no entertainment and WiFi and was delayed for an hour. Passangers were informed that they would get a compensation for the inconvenience but when I contacted VA customer relations they new nothing about compensation. I also was unable to use a Virgin lounge in London because my VS454 flight from Tel Aviv also was delayed and arrived to London late."
Margaret,"November 15, 2018",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"I flew first from London to Seattle and couldn’t believe the fantastic service, food, in-flight entertainment and staff. It was so good, I said to my friends and family that if that was Virgin’s economy class, I could only dream how brilliant their premium classes must be. I didn’t think Virgin could top the service on this flight until Air New Zealand dumped me in a broken seat for 13 hours which resulted in an injury to my leg, treated me like dirt, and I then used Virgin Atlantic to get from Hong Kong to London. Not only was the service every bit as good as the initial flight to Seattle, but they really went the extra mile when I showed them the doctors’ report explaining the extent of my Air New Zealand induced injury and asked only if I could please board priority to avoid my leg getting bashed. Their rep in Hong Kong immediately checked my seating (window) and then proceeded to clear that entire row at no extra cost and without me asking for this in order that I could sit with my leg elevated and not have to worry about knocking it if I needed to use the facilities. Assistance was also offered to and from the flights in Hong Kong and London if I needed it. I was absolutely stunned how kind and compassionate they all were both on the ground and in-flight. I am so glad Virgin Australia are divorcing their association with Air New Zealand as Virgin is clearly way too good a brand to be tarnished by that association. I really cannot thank you all at Virgin enough. Absolutely fantastic both before and after I needed assistance. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Margaret,"June 5, 2018",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,"I had two trips with Virgin Atlantic, first London to Seattle, second Hong Kong to London and I cannot stop raving about how good they were. I’d not flown for years and this is my first experience with Virgin. From now on, if I fly again, they will be my first choice. As an economy passenger, although I am short, there was plenty legroom, the seats were comfortable, both planes were very clean, in-flight entertainment was vast and excellent and the food was great; not like usual airline food. The staff were professional, helpful and friendly and if this is how they treat their economy passengers, I can only dream of how good other classes must be. They particularly proved their worth when I suffered an injury thanks to Air New Zealand dumping me in a broken seat for a 13 hour flight (please refer to my review, it will save you a lot of stress if you’re heading there if you don’t book with Air NZ; negligent and rude). By comparison, bearing in mind Virgin did not contribute to my injury, on asking if I could please board first to prevent my knee being bumped about, the check-in clerk not only immediately agreed, but also, noting the 13-hour night flight wasn’t full, he kindly cleared my entire row to give me a chance to elevate my leg and have clear access to use the facilities. I have to say Cathay Pacific were great too, but Virgin, everything was spot on, I really can’t fault them. For all the stress Air New Zealand caused, Virgin restored my faith in how airlines can treat their economy customers just by being approachable. Thanks Virgin, you’re the best!"
Calum,"September 1, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew First Class,10.0,5,4,5,5,,,5,Yes,"I flew to Dubai and Atlanta from London Heathrow I experienced both the upper class cabin and the premium economy I was very impressed with the service from the crew who are very keen to look after you. The seat was very comfortable and clean on every flight. The food was excellent in upper class. I would certainly fly with virgin again, and would recommend to a friend."
Natalie,"July 20, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,1.0,2,3,1,4,,,1,No,Arrived today from trip to Jamaica. My return flight with Virgin was unacceptable. The seating area of the plane was absolutely filthy with food and paper on the floor and trays un-wiped with food and white marks.
K,"June 6, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,10.0,4,4,5,5,,,5,Yes,"Best long haul economy flight I have taken in years compared to other airlines!!! Virgin Atlantic are a head of the game, keep it up. 10/10"
Barbara,"April 20, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,10.0,3,5,5,4,,,3,Yes,"Hopefully this will get read by the appropriate people, I have recently (15/04/17) travelled from  Orlando to Gatwick on flight VS28. I am extremely nervous during take off and informed an air hostess. Who offered me plenty of advice and support, during take off she held my hand and constantly reassured me and helped to reduce my panic. Throughout the flight she offered help and advice even informing another hostess when she had to work on a different section of the aeroplane. She definitely went out of her way to help me when I am really not only scared but embarrassed. I am writing this as I would like to say Thankyou to her and let her team know how good she is. Her name is Kelly.and I owe her a huge thank you."
Richard,"April 19, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew First,1.0,1,1,1,1,,,1,No,"My family were previously regular frequent Virgin Atlantic customers, always travelling in Upper Class on several flights per year and have done so for over 10 years. We always travel together, my wife and I and our 2 young children, so spend a lot of money."
Margaret,"April 17, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,6.0,4,4,4,5,,,4,Yes,First time travelling with virgin the fight out staff wee attentive and lots of snacks and drinks to keep us going x however flight back was very disappointing x wrong take off time displayed which meant we arrived at airport 2 and a half hours early x only  one meal provided and nothing else but water offered from 6 pm til 12 .  Not everything offered on the menu was available .Would have taken some sandwiches but because it was so good in way out we didn’t. Snack before we landed was a cheese croissant so after all that time my husband had nothing as he doesn’t like cheese .
Ken,"April 5, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,1.0,2,1,4,3,,,5,Yes,The new. 787 jets Virgin Atlantic is using are not passenger friendly!  The seats in Economy class have been shrunk down to a very uncomfortable size.  And the fools that designed the controls placing buttons and ports on the inside rail of the seat did not know what they were doing.  When sitting in the seat you can not operate them.  The headphone port causes the jack to protrude into your leg and broke three times on my last trip.  They are trying to squeeze out higher prophets aye the cost of passenger comfort.
shauna,"March 12, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,1.0,3,5,1,3,,,4,No,"I have never had such poor customer service in all my life.  Phones in Jhb not answered for HOURS.  No getting back, no support, just trying to pass the problem along the line … so not good"
gerald,"March 11, 2017",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,5,,,5,Yes,My first time to fly Virgin Atlantic.  Excellent service from check in to flight to Hong Kong . Went economic but the Staff treat you no different.  Hostess were so kind and helpful . Thank You for making my holiday so memorable
Lisa,"October 30, 2016",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,1.0,1,3,3,4,,,3,No,"I booked my flights eight months prior to flying, I paid Â£150 extra so all three passengers could sit together both ways as I am a really nervous passenger. 24hours prior to the return flights I tried to check in online but the airline wouldn’t allow this. We presented ourselves at Orlando international where the check in attendant made us aware that from Atlanta to Manchester none of us were sat together and my husband didn’t have a seat! We arrived in Atlanta and before reaching the gate I phoned virgin to ask them about my seats and they guaranteed me that my seats were booked, paid and reserved for my party of three. We presented ourselves at the Atlanta boarding gates to be told we weren’t sat together and that my husband didn’t have a seat, we were held in a hallway of some kind for 30minutes being given no information of what was happening, voulentees were being asked for to leave the flight and take a later flight. I burst into tears as my nerves overcame me, after 30 mins we were taken to the plane where we were brought to random seats sat separately, this was the worst 8 hours!! We also lost two suitcases."
N,"October 29, 2016",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Premium Economy,1.0,1,3,1,1,,,1,No,"I had high hopes for Virgin Atlantic but all I can say is that I really disliked my experience. The staff was rude and condescending. The poor treatment began from check-in. I normally fly with Cathay Pacific so I believe that the staff at the airport could see that I was a first-time flier with Virgin. Combining this with my younger age, I assume that they thought I would be easily intimidated. So, the lady tried to force me into sitting in Economy and getting a “free return ticket from anywhere in the world” ( most sophisticated airlines would provide monetary compensation. Why a free return ticket? That means I have to pay for a one-way ticket which is not worth it as I don’t fly with Virgin). I explained that this would not happen because I was in the highest premium economy booking class and had booked many months in advance.The air attendants were rude and unfriendly. They didn’t smile and glared all the time. Customer service needs retraining. Lastly, I tried to change my seat when checking in cause they had 34 seats available. But, I called, I tried online-  only at the airport! A backwards system."
emma,"May 13, 2016",Virgin Atlantic,5.3,Flew Economy,10.0,4,4,5,5,,,5,Yes,"We travelled in economy seats to orlando. The flight was brilliant,very comfy seats and great entertainment. Cabin crew was very friendly,helpfull and happy. We loved virgin atlantic."
Peter,"April 1, 2023",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,4,0,4,4,0,No,"After a long flight from Santiago to Sydney via Auckland, we missed our bus connection in Brisbane by about an hour because our flight had been cancelled & we were put onto a later flight. This neccessitated an overnight stay in a Brisbane hotel & the airline refuses to reimburse us. They use the excuse that our flight was ONLY delayed by a short time."
Kim,"July 26, 2022",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,5.0,3,2,2,1,3,2,4,Yes,"Staff are told to remind passengers that face masks must remain on during the flight duration exception for eating and drinking… Staff don’t seem to care about the safety of passengers during the duration of the flight seeing as how they never ask passengers to wear their mask. If I’m ever seated next to someone not wearing a mask I’ll make a complaint (it’s gonna happen eventually) I get it’s a budget airline, but it’s not a budget health risk."
Caleb,"April 25, 2022",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,8.0,4,5,5,2,5,5,3,Yes,Amazing service on Virgin Australia. Flight attendants and staff were friendly. Only had a small issue and that was a 30-minute delay in Brisbane before we got underway. Staff were extremely helpful and kept updating us when we could board. Unfortunately due to Covid Virgin now don’t serve an in-flight snack to economy class so I paid for food which was a little expensive. The in-flight entertainment was quite poor. I had trouble connecting to the free wifi and I couldn’t use the VA app. Other than that a really enjoyable flight and I would definitely recommend Virgin Australia to everyone. 8/10.
Jayne,"July 4, 2021",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Business Class,10.0,5,5,5,5,3,5,2,Yes,"My return flight from Perth to Broome was free with my ANZ Adventures credit card. I did a pre-flight bid for an upgrade to Business  and was successful. As it was morning, no alcoholic drinks were available in the lounge. I had a flat white and some cheese and biscuits and sat down in a comfy chair. The plane seats were roomy and the service was excellent. I had a sparkling wine before take-off and I had 2 more and a glass of red. I had a ‘toasted’ chicken sandwich for lunch. It was not toasted. It was microwaved. But it sure beats sitting in economy. I used the Virgin entertainment system on my ipad  which I had no problem connecting to or using."
Stephen,"July 9, 2019",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Business Class,4.0,1,3,5,2,2,1,2,No,"Had asked for Wheelchair assistance in February when the flight was booked. Upon landing, we waited for everyone else to disembark as usual. I was asked to place the wheelchair person onto the wheelchair. Even if I wanted to help, there were too many VA staff in the way. Once the chair movement was completed, the swap at the door to another wheelchair was required. Because the flight was well over an hour late, pre-arranged transport could not be there so we had to make our own way home (i.e – by taxi). Once in the luggage claim area, our assistance disappeared after telling me that i could manage the wheelchair. I could manage the wheelchair, but what about the luggage we also had. Fortunately the airport staff assisted me after I had tried to manoeuvre both the trolley and the luggage cart. Very poor way to treat any customer."
Susan,"June 17, 2019",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,0,0,0,,1,0,No,"BUYER BEWARE! 4 family members and myself booked a flight with Virgin Australia 7 months in advance of a major family event. My son was getting married in Indonesia. 10 days prior, I began getting notified of changes in flight times. After many hours on the phone and several calls later, I was lead to believe I was going to make it to my destination when planned. At time of check-in I was notified my flight was again delayed and I was going to miss my connecting flight that caused another delay at that airport. These were not short delays. With the delays incurred, all of the family members were going to miss my son’s wedding. The other family members were NEVER notified. Because we didn’t know before the time of check-in, none of the family were able to make it to my son’s wedding. Such a sad affair it ended up being!  My son had NO family at his wedding because of the airlines total lack of disregard for it passengers. How many other individuals on this flight were affected this way. I will never fly or recommend Virgin Airlines."
Gary,"April 9, 2019",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Business Class,9.0,4,4,5,4,5,5,4,Yes,The premium airline in Australia Domestically.. wish they could match their competition internationally.
Daleep,"April 15, 2018",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,5,4,4,,,4,Yes,Virgin Australia deserves to be 7/7 for service. Their leg space for their domestic flights was excellent Their crew was very kind. Their service was very quick when they were handing out some food and snacks. Their pilots were very detailed on their pre-takeoff and landing speeches which is good.
Josh,"April 5, 2018",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,4.0,3,4,5,2,,,1,Yes,"I am an aviation lover and a passionate traveller, and I wire this to anyone who is indecisive about which Airline to chose when they are traveling. I recently flew on Virgin Australia from Sydney to Perth. I have taken this specific route previously, and found my experience to be pleasing over all. Due to timing restraints, I was forced to take the 2:00pm flight, which unfortunately has a reputation for being one of Virgin’s inferior services. In short, I would have to agree. It presents one of the longest domestic flights offered in Australia (5 hours) in one of the smallest planes. I Arrived at Sydney Airport buzzed to embark upon my adventure. As I was only going to be in Perth for a few days I did not need to check-in a bag (this is a life saver, I would recommend if you don’t have much luggage). I printed my boarding pass with ease, and walked swiftly through to security. On the other side, I aimed straight for gate 38. The Virgin terminal in Sydney is an incredibly long walk, (of course the Perth gate is at the very end!) Prior to boarding the staff of my flight made a quick announcement to let customers know to download the “Virgin Australia In Flight Entertainment App”. Which basically meant my plane had no TVs on it… Boarding is usually very organised and efficient, however this was not the case on this flight. The staff were disorganised and the process was rather chaotic. They called the usual business class and priority passengers first. Those not of this status were forced to queue up, resulting in further disorder. However, I found that general boarding line was empty and when they opened the “general boarding” gate I got to walk straight through. The cabin layout for the 737-800 is a three-by-three configuration. I had the window seat and was right next to the wing of the plane. The legroom was spacious (although I am not particularly large). Unfortunately, the inkling I had about there not being TVs proved to be true. However, thanks to the staff who gave me plenty of warning I was prepared and had downloaded the entertainment app. Unfortunately, the movie, TV and entertainment choice was extremely limited (disappointing). They had an overwhelming number of romantic comedies: Bridesmaids, The Other Woman, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and Pretty Woman (just to name a few). Despite this array of ‘chick-flicks’, the only movie that helped consume my time was Keanu Reeve’s latest hit, John Wick (highly recommend!) The take-off was very smooth and we climbed to the cruising altitude quite speedily with very little turbulence which is always commendable. The seatbelt sign flicked off and the announcement that we all had been waiting for had arrived, “the meal service for you today is the choice of Pesto pasta with chicken or vegetarian noodles”. This was definitely not the most exciting choices I have ever had presented to me. Around 15 minutes later the trolley came to my row. I ended up choosing the pasta (was feeling a bit like pasta in the moment – how naive). There were some nice touches. The pasta came with a mini sticky-date pudding. The food was presented in a maccas-style ‘Happy Meal’ box as opposed to the moist residue aluminium foil wrapping that we are so accustomed to. And as a final touch, the packaging was stamped with a little smiley black and red smiley-face on it. When I opened it, my excitement immediately dwindled. The pasta (if you could call it that) looked like it had been mistaken for a dog’s dinner! The chicken was bone dry and covered in a wet red paste which I assumed to be penne sauce. I am no Italian food connoisseur, but from my limited knowledge penne and pesto are not one-in-the-same. I was utterly shocked that a premium airline like this could serve a meal of such low quality. Another thing that confused me was they brought out the food first and about 10-15 minutes later they brought out the drinks. I was quite thirsty after my meal and I had to wait which was both frustrating and dehydrating. In conclusion, I would recommend stocking up on snacks before boarding.   About an hour into the flight the smooth sailing that I was enjoying gave in and the turbulence hit the plane. We rocked violently for about 20 minutes. The rest of the flight remained bumpy. This was probably due to the aircrafts size which would not be able to cope with the high winds that were at the altitude. I must say the staff were very friendly and very kind. They were also efficient around the cabin and tended to everyone’s needs. After the long 5 hours we finally began our descent into Perth. The landing was smooth. I looked out my window and saw the wing, which looked to be in an alarming state. It was fully contracted back which was normal for a landing but there seemed to be a lot of rust in the wing (photo doesn’t do it justice). I must say the new Virgin Australia terminal in Perth airport is absolutely stunning. Once I landed I just walked straight through the terminal, not needing to wait for my luggage and hopped straight in a taxi.   I would rate virgin Australia’s Sydney to Perth service on the 737 about a 4.5/10. On the one hand, the plane was small and old, the entertainment was not the best, the food was absolutely horrific and the turbulence frightening. However, on the other hand I can say that the service from the cabin crew was fantastic and I think if I were on the a330 things would be quite different. I will continue to support Virgin Australia as an airline, but would recommend avoiding the smaller flights, and aim for the prime-time slot on the bigger planes. This will make for a more enjoyable experience than the one I have commented on. By Josh Paul"

Jordan,"February 16, 2018",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,4,5,4,,,4,Yes,"Two friends and I flew to Hamilton Island from Melbourne with Virgin Australia. We had originally booked direct flights to and fro through Webjet a month before our trip, but to our surprise a week or so later the flights had been changed/cancelled. We had been placed on a flight from Brisbane to Hamilton Island (going there) and another from Sydney to Melbourne (returning home). Finding this odd I called up the Virgin customer service team who informed me that I would have to call Webjet to book us a flight to get us to Brisbane from Melbourne and another to get us from Hamilton Island to Sydney. We were then given two more Virgin flights to help us reach our destination and to come back home. Having this experience prior to commencing my trip I was hesitant to fly with Virgin. However I was very pleased with the service that Virgin had provided. All Virgin staff that I had encountered were very pleasant and kept a smile on their faces and made the flights very enjoyable. There were no seatback tv’s on the Virgin aircraft, however passengers were informed prior to boarding and on the flight before departure that an app was available to use to stream and watch movies/tv shows. Coming back from Hamilton Island our flight from Sydney to Melbourne was cancelled and we had not found out about this cancellation until we had deboarded the plane from Hamilton Island. However, after arriving into the Virgin terminal at Sydney our names were paiged over the speakers and we were instructed to make our way back to the gate of the aircraft we had just gotten off. It was there we were handed new boarding passes to another flight to Melbourne that departed EARLIER than our original scheduled flight. We were not seated together on this flight, however the staff member at the gate explained to us that it was a full plane and there were only three more seats left to accommodate us. Overall we were pleased with our experience with Virgin Australia. We did experience a few hiccups with the cancellation of flights, however Virgin staff assisted us as much as they could, and the experience that we received on board compensated for any of the problems we faced. Would definitely recommend flying with Virgin Australia."
ron,"January 10, 2018",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy Class,5.0,2,4,3,1,,,1,No,"flew from cairns to brisbane recently. the flight was okay, but for a full service airline i would not say a bottle of water and a pack of two cookies is an appropriate meal service, the flight departed on time and arrived on time, the crew were a little rude and abrupt almost as though they were at the end of a 12 hour shift and were over it."
Susan,"August 16, 2017",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy,3.0,1,2,2,0,,,2,No,"No text notification for Virgin flight cancellation in Hobart yesterday – due to bad weather at destination.  Waited four hours in the airport.  Tiring for us but other passengers missed international connections.  Staff were unavailable or indifferent.  In the time we were waiting, we watched two Qantas flights take off and one Jetstar flight (same destination as us).  Qantas passengers were constantly kept informed and compensated with refreshment vouchers.  Nothing but silence and absent staff for Virgin passengers…"
Kimberley,"August 16, 2017",Virgin Australia,7.0,Flew Economy,2.0,1,1,2,0,,,1,No,"The worst check in process in Denpassar last night. Will not ever travel with this airline again. No blanket, inflight entertainment and eight dollars for two bottles of water. Gurauda has it all over Virgin"
Denys,"April 22, 2016",Virgin Australia Regional,8.0,Flew Economy,10.0,4,3,5,4,,,4,Yes,"I flew economy Virgin Australia Perth- Melbourne return. first leg on 11 april 2016 VA690  and return on 19 april 2016, VA683. The crew was very professional and friendly. Legroom is not generous but they make it up through great service. On the return journey, I had more legroom which was was much appreciated and the flight arrived 30 minutes early which was a pleasant surprise. Will definitely recommend Virgin Australia."
P,"March 8, 2016",Virgin Australia Regional,8.0,Flew Economy,4.0,2,3,1,0,,,0,No,flew from Cairns to Queenstown via Brisbane.  The second leg- international flight -was not enjoyable.  The crew was rude and lazy.  Only saw them when drinks were served. They spent a lot of time talking and on their phones. There was no complementary meal unless you wanted to pay for it.  There was a charge for soda and even orange juice.
Sharon,"February 13, 2013",Virgin Australia Regional,8.0,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,4,0,,,4,Yes,"Flew from Perth to Exmouth on a Fokker 100. Never have i flown on a plane with so much legroom! The seats reclined and there were newspapers scattered over every few seats. The flight was fairly empty so most people could have their own row. We were given a breakfast of cereal, milk, juice and a bread roll with butter and jam as well as tea and coffee. I woudl definitely fly them again and think they offer great value for money  – I couldn’t drive to Exmouth for the price of a ticket"
Kellie,"February 13, 2013",Virgin Australia Regional,8.0,Flew Economy,8.0,3,5,5,3,,,4,Yes,We flew from Perth to Exmouth return for a friends wedding. As a favour to the bride I carried the wedding cake with me on the plane. The staff of Skywest were very helpful and accommodating to my husband and I. They put us in a row with three seats so that I could have the cake beside me on the plane. I have flown with Skywest several times and the aspect I most enjoy about flying with them is the comfortable seating and amount of leg room. The service and food has generally always been of a high standard too. I prefer Skywest over Qantas however their pricing is often higher than Qantas
Sanidhya,"August 18, 2023",Vistara,3.8,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Worst airlines ever.Don’t ever travel with them. The food is extremely pathetic. the staff is extremely rude. Plus they delay their flights for 14+ hours and don’t even show mercy. It has been 3 months and they still haven’t  given the compensation to the customers of the flight. they put in my details wrong even after several times me sending them right documents. Plus worst services, they are not even reliable. Better travel in spicejet or even airindia is better at service than vistara."

Andreas,"May 6, 2021",Vistara,3.8,Flew Business Class,8.0,4,5,5,3,5,5,4,Yes,"Professional, Polite, Personal. Providing good service on international flights during pandemic is a challenge and Vistara did a good job here on their new DEL to FRA sector. But do keep in mind the flight was only half full. Covid protocols were followed strictly and enforced gently where needed. Given the departure time of 3:15am the food service is of less importance, the breakfast however was served in good time and delicious. The 787 is always a pleasant experience anyway – and the exceptional baggage allowance of 3x32kg one of the reasond why I chose business class this time."

Due to flight delay, I missed the connection flight and was put on a flight on the next day in the morning although there were flights on the same night. The airline sent a sms stating the delay was due to a technical problem. At the airport counter the personnel said it was instructed to say the delay was due to weather which was a sheer lie because other flights in the same direction and at the same time took place on time. They refused any reimbursement for the hotel that was paid for at the destination, no accommodation for the night, no food, not even WATER on plane!!! How sick is that! The personnel when confronting immediately lost the ability to speak English. This company has to get out of business with such attitude towards customers. Their shuttle service is the same crap. Better order Uber or taxi. You won’t save anything with this SHARED transportation, only get a headache."

Do yourself a favor and fly with another one, viva aerobus is not worth the money. They should pay you to fly with them. Rude customer service, delay all the time. I had a almost 4 hour delay, and we had to wait for fuel inside the airplane. My luggage was open and got stolen a few things and not one employee was able to tell me how to proceed to open a report or claim. After a couple of days they wanted to reimburse me with a viva aerobus certificate…. for what? I ain’t flying with this crappy airline ever again!"

The flight experience is just as bad, with agents at airports corraling and treating customers like livestock at the actual airport, abusing their anti-consumer policies further by forcing people to be up charged for bags, and being downright unpleasant in the flight. Their flight attendants need more training in people skills as do the rest of their staff throughout the company."

Rebecca,"April 3, 2022",Viva Aerobus,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,3,3,0,0,,,0,No,"We booked a flight online from Oaxaca to Phoenix at the beginning of March. It had been six years since we had seen our family due to Covid. Our flight from Oaxaca to Mexico city was with Viva.  We were about an hour late taking off and then when we were supposed to land in MC the plane almost touched down then went back up and circled rhe whole city before finally landing. We have never been to the airport in MC so we didn’t realize that the two terminals were three miles apart. We are both in our sixties so we can’t walk very fast so by the time we got to our gate the boarding was closed. We have flown all over the world on many different airlines and have never missed a flight, not once. We tried talking with a manager for Viva who did absolutely nothing but give us the run around. We had to spend two nights in MC before we could catch another flight. What bothered us the most was the lack of any kind of support from Viva. I guarantee we will never fly with this airline in the future."
NATALIA,"December 30, 2021",Viva Aerobus,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"My first flight was delayed 3 hours. VIVA AEROBUS hasn’t even updated the information about the plane being delayed at the airport. I kept checking the screens, and even 2 hours after the plane was supposed to take off, the screens showed the status of the flight: on time. The application kept showing diferent times of departure, and the employe at the window was more and more scared. I stopped asking him after a while. Finally, we boarded the plane just to sit there for an hour because they didn’t have any fuel. ?. I’m at the airport now to get the flight back, and I got all excited because the plane  actually came from Mexico City on time  to pick us up from Oaxaca. Unfortunately, they told us that we can’t board the plane because it’s delayed. The application stopped working and doesn’t give any updates about the status of the plane. This is my last flight with this airline."
Jessica,"November 7, 2021",Viva Aerobus,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"The worst part was trying to get a hold of the company. I had been calling and trying different menus for hours in the airport and talking in circles with the bot. Whenever I got a hold of someone, they would transfer me and drop my call. Terrible communication and it’s impossible to get a real person.  When I finally reached Debra and the manager Eduardo, they helped very little and only gave a refund on the flight they canceled, not the flight that I had as my return (which I couldn’t even use since I wasn’t there!) Overall a terrible experience with both the airlines at the airport, the manager, and the call center. Don’t use this airline if you want to get somewhere within a couple of days. They are unreliable and don’t compensate when they don’t deliver on their promises."
Rosa,"July 2, 2021",Viva Aerobus,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Do not fly with Viva! My husband and I had purchased tickets to fly from Tijuana to Los Cabos for our summer vacation. We purchased these tickets over 2 months in advance. We received an email from Viva Aerobus two weeks prior to our flight stating that our outgoing flight was cancelled and that we would be placed on a flight that was 6 hours later that day. I accepted as I saw no other option. The next day, I was sent another email saying that my incoming flight was cancelled and that there were no other direct flights available on that day. The other flights were 5+ hours long, instead of 2 hours, and they departed at times that did not work for us. I called Viva to get a refund. They said that I did not qualify for a refund. Keep in mind that they cancelled my flight and ruined my vacation. Get this. I had even purchased the refund insurance just in case something like this happened. Viva said that my insurance did not cover the airline cancelling our flight."

I sent them 3 different types of proof that i am covid positive, lab results, doctors certificates, results with the state seal and nothing they say thats not enough!!

We recently just go back from Mexico and again they lost my luggage or as the representative said it probably was never put on the plane. I was told they would be in touch the next day and yet to hear from them regarding this.  I had no hopes of hearing back from them as this is not the first time this has happened and no response back.  Not sure why this happens but it is very upsetting.  Needless to say, I’m done with flying charter flights.  Viva Aerobus you’ve lost my business."
Kay,"July 18, 2019",Viva Aerobus,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"I work at a NPO, and we took a trip with about 20 interns. When we go to check-in, the airline insists on weighing each person’s bags together. Some kids’ bags were at 7kg, and others were at 10.3kg and they wanted us to pay $50usd for the ones that were over. We weren’t going to pay for 10 or so kids’ bags because they were a bit over, so we start rearranging the baggage to spread the weight more evenly. At the gate, the agents (incredibly rude/impatient), insisted on charging us for the bags that were “over” (by .3kg) AGAIN, though we showed our receipts. They held the flight for about 1 & 1/2 hours because they were busy hassling us. After we ended up paying for 3 of the kids bags (TWICE), we finally boarded the flight. Because we had layovers each direction, we ended up flying with the airline 3 times, and each experience was equally horrific. We literally sat on the airport floor and threw away toiletries, clothing, books, shoes, etc. and moved items around bags to meet their ridiculous requirements, constantly reweighing the bags to try to avoid paying $100s in additional fees."
Julio,"July 15, 2018",Viva Aerobus,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,2,1,,,0,No,"I have traveled extensively both domestically and internationally and have never been so disappointed as I have with Viva Aerobus. My 4 beautiful days in Ajijic ended badly thanks to Viva Aerobus (VA). First of all, you can’t check-in online within 24 hrs of departure. But in all fairness, I’m not sure if it’s airport policy or because VA hasn’t caught on. So I had to be there 2.5 hrs prior to departure, checked in and was given my “VIP” group boarding pass. As we were boarding the plane, several of us were asked to step aside and go to another line to weigh and or measure our hand carry-on bags. When they took my bag, a man, without looking at me in the eyes, proceeded to invoice me for US $52 because my bag was 1″ above the limit. He never even showed me the measurements! Mind you, I’ve used the same bag traveling to Europe, Asia and multiple US domestic flights and had NO problems. Because I felt like I was being bullied by the “polecias”, I paid the US $52 and was asked to give my bag to someone by the door of the plane. There was no one there so I proceeded to take my bag in and placed it in the overhead bin. And guess what? It fit perfectly as expected and like it has with all my other flights in the past. Also, it would be nice if VA would send us all an email warning us of their strict policies and perhaps mention that THEIR SEATS DO NOT RECLINE AND HAVE NO ENTERTAINMENT ON BOARD. So much for being in a “VIP” that they couldn’t even accommodate a bag that’s 1″ over their limit. Perhaps the US $52 they collected from me cost VA prospective passengers because of this review. One thing for sure, I WILL NEVER FLY VivaAerobus EVER AGAIN!"
Isaiah,"March 4, 2023",Volaris,2.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Worst flights ever. Flying into Mexico, the delayed our flight by 3 hours and didn’t allow refunds even though it was due to short staff. Then we went to their agency to do the online reservation confirmation and we added 1 suitcase and they stated it was $350. I asked if it would be in US dollars or Mexican pesos. They stated Mexican pesos. I then proceeded to add on 2 suitcases. My total came out to almost $5,000 pesos. I asked why it was that price and she stated “it was a mistake and it was in dollars not pesos. Then stated she couldn’t remove one suitcase because it had already been added. When we ORIGINALLY asked if would be in US dollars or pesos. Next on our return flight we were delayed for over 3 hours due to engine issues. Didn’t move us to another plane/ another flight just had us sitting while we waited. Worst airline ever. They love scamming peoples money and time."

Ana,"October 6, 2021",Volaris,2.1,Flew Economy Class,3.0,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,No,"I had a very frustrating experience on my last flight with Volaris from Zacatecas to Chicago. I noticed there were at least 3 families with minors that were given separate seats. I had a 9, 16 and 18 year old traveling with me, we bought our tickets together and still none of us got to sit together. To me, it seems that Volaris is separating families and companions that buy their tickets together to force passengers to pay for seat selection. I did my check-in immediately after the 24 hour allowed it. In the vicinity where I was seated, I saw there were at least two couples that were also separated. Besides this making flying less comfortable it doesn’t help with maintaining some separation from strangers during this pandemic. It doesn’t make sense to be splitting families apart just to make a profit. I strongly believe they purposefully do this to force passengers to pay more for seat selection. Since we opt out of paying for the seat selection, they make the choices inconvenient instead of just sitting families together. There were a few passengers around me that were traveling alone, they did not pay extra for their seats."
Brenda,"June 18, 2021",Volaris,2.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"I’m very very disappointed, frustrated and upset with this airline!

To top it all off, there were no available flights until 10pm!! After having to wait for so long, my flight still got delayed until 12am. My daughter gets married in the morning and here I was in the airport tired, hungry and more. This airline is a piece of crap and gives 0 s&/*s about its customers. Be ready for unprofessional excuses and a “credit” for their unprofessio al changes. The credit they gave me was “2,000  towards my next flight which had to be done by July (mean within a month). They have definitely lost several customers and can expect nothing but bad reviews from me, my family and everyone around me. Thank you Volaris for the WORSE TRIP IN MY LIFE!"

Daniel,"May 9, 2020",Volaris,2.1,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"Volaris let me know my flight was being scheduled on a different day. I turn to calling the company’s customer service to get to the bottom of this. My first interaction with a member at Volaris DROPPED the call as soon as I was put on hold. No biggie, I call back and go through the mundane steps to reach another human. Hurray, I reach another member who again, puts me on hold and once again, my call gets dropped. Ok, I can call again as my plans are wide open, but this happened again and again for over an hour. Once I did get through and got David, who does spend some time trying to explain to me that I wasn’t getting my money back and wouldn’t even receive half of what I paid with airline coupons, I was pretty much done with this company. David gave me a confusing explanation that he couldn’t articulate to the level of my understanding in which case, I asked to speak to a manager. David was unwilling to connect me and told me “there’s no manager who can help you as this is the rule and has already been decided”."

Seats are too closed. I was surprised they didn’t charge me for the air while I was flying. The staff is so rude with lowest service. The airline due to this COV-19 canceled my flight, which it’s understandable. so I though it was going to be the same as the other airlines, I decided to contact them just to find out it was no way to contact anyone anywhere. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO CONTACT ANYBODY via phone or line call this number (866) 988-3527 over and over just to realized that after waiting 40-50 minutes the line cut off and if you get thru the line they hung up on you.

Now they say I can get a refund (got a new email today) but have to call to get it. I have been on hold for over an hour. I will never get it. Trust me on this.

They said through it in the trash.  they just laughed at us and looked at us like we were stupid, I got very anger, so they kicked us of the flight and never even refunded the bag fees or the $360 we payed for the flights.. they said that because I had gotten so angry they had the right not to let us board on the flight.  what ever you do don’t fly with Volaris!!!!"

My confirmation number was not found so I can only assume they canceled my reservation rather than addressing my concerns expressed in my email..  I’m saddened to learn of their poor business practices because we have many friends on their routes and we would have liked to use them in the future.  Not only is this unlikely now, but we will also share your rudeness to them.  There are other airlines albeit more expensive, but are much easier to communicate with.  Once reservation is made, and after 24 hours, NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS!  They charge a separate fee for everything–even carryons.  Their low rates are simply a come on and are not worth it."

They decided to remove my bag from the plane 5 days ago due to their own error of “miscalculating the weight” and still have not returned it to me. I went my entire vacation without my bag (no clothes, personal supplies, certain medications, shoes, etc.). I spent hours both in person and on the phone with them, and they refuse to provide any written guarantee or amount of compensation, so I had no guarantee that any sorely needed replacement items I bought would be covered. They still haven’t delivered my bag or agreed to compensate me, meaning at this point they have essentially stolen my belongings in addition to ruining my vacation. Last I spoke with them, they couldn’t even say for sure where my bag is, yet they still refuse to pay me for loss and damages. Stay FAR, far away and use an ethical, trustworthy airline instead."

Delayed once, 18:30, then 20:30, 22:30… no announcement or staff of Volotea showing up. We only had the info from the panel. Delayed again 00:30…. And finally cancelled. Volatea arranged a shittle but yo a hotel, but we had to pay the taxi back to the airport the day after. The flights of the day after were so expensive and has a bad time that we preffered to cancel our whole trip as it was only 2 nights. Our insurance company refused to pay the hotel nights in santorini we could not use, as it was booked before. So we went through all of this without even an excuse email or seeing anyone from Volotea. One advice, never use this terrible company."
Tugce,"December 17, 2022",Volotea,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"Physical Assault and Extortion by Volotea Airlines! I was physically assaulted by two employees of Volotea Airlines in Palma de Mallorca airport Spain and denied boarding when I didn’t want to pay an illegal extra fee of €50 for my cabin bag. Volotea’s allowed range measurement for free cabin bag is (40x30x20cm) and My bag is (40x19x15cm). Employees didn’t speak English and yelled at me and shoved me around saying PAY or GO, PAY or GO! Even though I didn’t understand Spanish, they were also shouting in Spanish and bullying me like Gestapo Nazis. They were extremely rude and physical, and I am a 155cm woman. It wasn’t called for! They deliberately wanted me to miss the plane. I had a connecting flight to Sardinia and I couldn’t miss the plane, so I had to pay eventually. Even though I paid the fee, they didn’t let my cabin bag to stay in the cabin, so I almost missed my connecting flight to Sardinia. I complained to the company about the incident and asked for a refund but they said there’s nothing they can do. This was completely illegal action. Worst Airline Ever!!!"
Nita,"January 14, 2022",Volotea,3.3,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"During the summer we bought tickets with Volotea to travel from Thessaloniki to Mykonos – which got cancelled. I asked for refund of the ticket’s amount in August 2021 and to this day have not yet received it. I’ve sent a dozen of emails which are always replied in the same vague way making me wait 4-6 weeks each time they “try” to make the transfer – which according to them fails. There is no follow-up on the case at all and each time I reach out I have to explain the whole situation again, and they never really try to find a solution. I feel like I’m talking with an automated program, awful customer service. Since it’s been almost 6 years I will work with a lawyer and sue the company – which seems to be the only way to get back the money that is rightfully mine. This is pretty much the same with stealing. I will never purchase a ticket in Volotea again. Never."

My flight was changed by 11 hours, so I had the right to a refund. I was back and forth with them for months, they wanted me to take the credit of course. I chose the refund. I saw something saying 90% of people would have their refunds by the end of July, guess I wasn’t one of them because by October I still hadn’t heard anything. Finally they emailed me and said they had found a “wrong” with my bank account and the payment had been rejected. That’s funny, there didn’t seem to be a “wrong” when you took the money in the first place. I’ve emailed them several times since and they maintain that they’ve refunded me already despite the fact I’ve sent them screenshots of my bank account. Do not fly with these criminals.

Having booked with multiple airlines for our holiday, which is impacted by COVID, we expected to lose $$$. All the other airlines have cancelled their flights or were willing to refund our tickets – so we got our $$ back luckily. Volotea is NOT one of those. I checked our booking online – we have -$350.00 to pay? Our flight has been moved 38 hrs later from the original time we booked it? This tells me they’ve cancelled our flight and put us on another which has a cheaper fare. But no! Apparently the flight is still ‘on time’ ! How is 38 hours later on time!? And why owe me money if my flight and seat is the same!? There is nobody there to call to plead with, they don’t respond to emails, and their online chat doesn’t rarely work even in the hours they state. One time I did manage to chat with someone, they were so rude and disconnected me! Unless you’re willing to risk your money then I (like many others on their social media page) would stay away!"

This company has adamantly denied to refund anything! They claim we made the choice to use our flex option and those are the rules and we should have waited to see if the flight was cancelled for which they would have given a full refund. Outrageous, why gamble that we would have lost the full cost with not cancelling in a timely manner. I have pleaded with them that this is not the usual situation in the world and we all have to be flexible but they would not budge. This is sad that a big airline would lose a customer over $180 during a global pandemic. I do not know if we will be able to use the credit but will NEVER EVER even consider Volotea for a flight.

I never ate noodle neither did anyone of them inform me why I didn’t.

After 30 min in their airplane in very bad shape I heard a big noise and minutes after the pilot spoke in Italian (he didn’t say a word in English) that they had a technical problem and had to make an emergency landing in Athens. It was a nightmare we thought the airplane would crush as it didn’t have any stability. It was my worst experience ever. After that, I had a conextion in Venice with another airline and a member of the staff said it was not their problem (very rude staff).

There was further delay when we arrived to the ORY airport in Paris where we spent 30 endless minutes waiting to disembark. We missed connecting flight with Vueling by 5 mins.

Worse still is that we have a connecting flight in two hours, but there’s no recommendation of a solution for our situation, they only want to make max. profit out of you and don’t even bother to talk to you.

Eve,"June 19, 2023",Vueling,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,Do not take this airline they will totally rip you off. I had five tickets booked on this airline from Paris to Dublin. The fine print said that the check in gate would close 40 minutes prior to take off. I arrived an hour before and was told that the boarding  was closed. I was told I should have read the fine fine print which says the 40 minute rule did not apply to this airport by clicking on a link. However when I clicked on the link I just got a bunch of frequent asked questions so unless I went searching for that information I would never know. To make matter worse they said I would not get my money back had to pay even more to rebook my flight. The bottom line is they did not care to do anything to help me at all and it cost me overall $1500. To make matters worse the information they sent me said the flight was to leave from terminal three and if was actually terminal 1. If they had given Me the right info too might have had enough time.

Mark,"May 9, 2023",Vueling,1.6,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,No,"Vueling is far and away the worst airline I’ver ever flown.  When the passenger in the row ahead of you reclines, his or her seatback is (I’m guesstimating) six or seven inches from your face.  The flight attendants were nice, and that’s the only good thing I can think of in writing this review.  We had “NOML” on our boarding passes, so we were regularly bypassed and denied food when food was being distributed.  I had to specially order food and drink for around 24 euros.  The hugely overpriced food Vueling served me was evidently contaminated, because I had major indigestion for the latter portion of the flight.  (I rarely have indigestion).  I will NEVER fly this airline again.  The sooner Vueling goes out of business the better off the flying public will be."

Next flight we were put on was some 12 hours later!!! To top it all off once we arrived in Barcelona after 1am the next day none of our checked in luggage arrived. Still to date 2 bags are lost and Vueling cannot tell us which county the bags are in. They are clueless and have no idea where they are.  Staff rude and stupidly incompetent.

But Vueling lost my checked-in luggage (7th June flight), where I had my valuables and essentials for my child. I am writing this review on the 20th August, yet Vueling is unable to resolve this issue. From the second week of my calls to their customer service, they are saying they have found my luggage at the Santorini airport, with their partner Goldair Handling and I am still waiting for it to be delivered. Vueling said their contract with Goldair Handling does not allow them to chase them for luggage, eventually asked me to chase Goldair Handling myself and provided me Goldair Handling number, which can also be found on the website. The phone continues to ring for last 2 months, but no one picks. No one responds to your email. Same with Vueling, there is no fruitful email communication. Eventually I claimed for the lost luggage and Vueling offered me £348, when value of my items are around £1400 – £1500. I didnot accept their valuation and they do not responding to my emails."

Mark,"March 5, 2020",Vueling,1.6,Flew Economy Class,2.0,2,1,3,1,3,2,2,No,"BCN – MAN  12 December 2019. First  impression was the seating. Truly terrible, without doubt the worst that I have seen in any passenger aircraft. I have seen better seats on buses. Horrid, bolt upright, brown plastic narrow seats with restricted pitch. In comparison, Ryanair seating is relatively comfortable! If I hadn’t had a row of seats to myself, this would have been an extremely uncomfortable flight indeed. When I arrived in MAN after a 2hr15min flight, my back, bottom and legs that had been in contact with the seat were wet with sweat, a horrible experience. A step too far, even for a low-cost carrier, this new seating is a disgrace and whilst it may be acceptable for a 10 minute trip into town on the bus, there is no way that passengers should be expected to endure such discomfort and unhygienic stickiness on a 2hr+ flight, just so an airline can cram in an extra row of seats in a cynical drive to maximise profit. Catering expensive and uninspired, especially for a Spanish airline. Flight did not leave BCN nor did it arrive in MAN punctually."

We are from Georgia so we don’t get a lot of opportunity to fly with that airline. We booked our trip in mid 2019, well ahead of the COVID-19 issues arising. We received confirmation a couple of weeks ago that our flights had been cancelled. We called Travelocity to request a refund. We were able to do this painlessly for our Delta flights out. They advised WestJet would not allow a refund. We called WestJet to request a refund and were told they were not issuing any refunds, but would credit us on their airline for a future flight. With no opportunity to fly this airline easily, being from Georgia, this does us no good. With us booking so far in advance, and this issue being totally out of our hands you would think an airline would be more accommodating with a refund. I will make sure to spread the word to everyone I know to avoid this airline. If they have no interest in providing customer service in this unavoidable circumstance, it shows their true colors."

I do realize that but I was hoping in the spirit of Christmas and with my child being somewhat stranded they might make an exception for which I was very willing to pay.  I received a very polite NO.  My only option was to forfeit the purchased ticket and purchase another at full price.  The lady I spoke with was very nice and pointed out I had received rock bottom pricing on the ticket we purchased.  At over $800 for the round trip I really didn’t feel that was rock bottom pricing but I suppose that just confirmed to me that Westjet was no longer the kind, caring smaller airline that goes out of their way to accommodate customers."

They are very stringent with the rules and do not care about the customers at all. I have seen them preying on customers to get more money by measuring and weighing customers bags to the gram/mm. They have absolutely no compassion either, if you need to change or cancel your flight because a direct family member has died, or been taken to hospital, or if you have had a family emergency preventing you from keeping your reservation they will still charge you to cancel it or change it, they will not even allow you credit to use later. There is no such thing as ‘consideration of special circumstances’ with this company despite their website saying there is. The Wizz air attitude is that the Customer comes last. I say again, do not use Wizz Air unless you have no other option!"
Pat,"August 4, 2016",Wings Air,4.8,Flew Economy,1.0,1,4,2,0,,,0,No,I flew with Wings Air (part of Lion Air) as a part of a party of four surfers. We travelled from Bali to Sumbawa Besar via Lombok on Tuesday 19/7/16 and made the return trip on Friday 29/7/16.
Lorne,"July 12, 2015",Wings Air,4.8,Flew Economy,6.0,4,4,3,0,,,4,No,The aircraft (equivalent to a Dash 8) was relatively new so no problem with the quality of the aircraft. Cabin crew were average. Little to no smiles. However I have traveled with this carrier 3 times now and each time the flight was delayed for at least an hour. Not happy with that so will avoid in the future if I can. Be careful if you have a connecting flight.
Peter,"July 17, 2013",Wings Air,4.8,Flew Economy,10.0,5,5,5,4,,,5,Yes,"We took one of the flights to Pokhara, tourist destination of Nepal in ATR 42-320 of Buddha Air. It was a marvelous flight with great hospitality on board. Buddha Air is world famous for its mountain flight and planning to go for it next time..Thanks to Buddha Air..Great flying experience.."
Vladimir,"August 31, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,Yes,"Wizzair is the worst airline ever. They alowed to broke the international law as they are “privetly owned airline company”. That how they explaned the issue that they refuse to my family to fly to Turkey because passport of my son is expaired less than in 120 days. However based on onternational law that rule (about 120 days) works only if going out to Turkey from the airport. But if you a transit passanger, an not leaving transit section of the airport you dont need any local visa as well as 120 days rule… BUT Immigration officer said that they are privet airlines and they can break the law."
joanne,"August 9, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. They are bunch of crooks!  They charged me for luggage at the gate, even though as it turns out my son’s bag was within the correct measurements. But what’s worse is that when I tried to check in on line in Athens, the website was down. I went to the FAQs / Help Centre but nothing there to help me. No even a phone number.  I was charged £50 per person at Athens for THEIR error and when I went to claim from them when I returned, they refused, advising that there was no evidence that I had tried to check in online. I had photographs of the app showing an error message.  But nothing. Overall the flight cost me £400 on top of the original fee. The staff are rude and ignorant.  NEVER EVER FLY WITH THEM. The cheap tickets are a CON."
Mark,"August 9, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,,1,1,No,"The worst company ever, after 7 hours, we were told by the captain the original plane had broken down in Cyprus, when we got home and tried to claim compensation we were told the issue was with air traffic control, they sent me an email stating  [IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please note that, given the UK’s exit from the European Union, as of 1 January 2021, people living in the UK (ie have a UK registered mail address) will not be able to use the European Commission online. Dispute resolution platform as an alternative dispute resolution body]. On the flight home the automatic check in we paid for did not work, we paid for seat selection with extra leg room, they changed our seats to row 39 without extra leg room, when we boarded i had to ask the cabin crew for wet wipes to clean our seats as the had coke and food on the, so did the gentleman in front of us, the cabin crew stood there while we cleaned our seats, this was the first and last time I will ever use this airline, and I would advise everyone to avoid  this terrible company"
Giannis,"July 12, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"The worst airline in Europe, possibly the world. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM! Even if its cheap the time you lose from your with delays noone will give you back. Only if its your only option."

Sayak,"June 26, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,0,0,,,0,No,"Hello this is about my worst experience till date. I was about to fly Wizz Air  from Rome Fiumicino to India via Riyadh Flight no- (W68393) and I was denied boarding on grounds of nothing. Aereoporto Leonardo Da Vinci Fiumicino staff at #Wizzair  counter were extremely rude and all they said is I need E-visa to enter Saudi. While I said ok and asked to just tell me how to go on about it they did not tell anything and asked to go away. I met the info desk and that was same, they just told me to go to the Wizz Air counter. The travel agency downstairs was closed and no one could help.. The Italian police even they were useless. And most of them couldn’t speak proper English. Horrible experience. They did not give me a form for denied boarding as well. I have filed a legal complaint against Wizz Air and Fiumicino airport staff but of no use till now. The flight was back on 18th-December, 2022. The Agency has been just trying to dodge its way and Wizz air too. They don’t even respond to emails."
Ion,"March 4, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,No,"I had flights with many companies but Wizz Air is the most terrible one, in my opinion is illegal how they operate the issues. I bought a flight from Cluj, Romania, to Liverpool with return. The flight was cancelled and they paid in Wizz Air account just one way and without possible to take money back into my account. For the other way they don’t paid. I did a claim and from 25.06.2022 until 14.03.2023 they don’t fixed the issue. In one email they said will pay me back 480€ and to send them the bank details, what i did but no any money and no any answer. After few months of complaining they sent me an email and said the compensation of 400€ was intiated on 16.01.2023 and in maximum 20 days i must see the money in my account. Nothing, not even a penny they paid, i called the bank and i seen they lied. Now nobody answer to emails. Actually what they do is to pull the time and lie the costumers. Avoid this company is very dangerous."
Nikolay,"January 16, 2023",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,2.0,3,3,4,4,4,1,4,No,"I often use wizzair due to the prises. If everything works fine, they are OK for the money. However, if anything needs to be tuned, also on their responsibility, like system crash or unavailability of the website, you find yourself lost in a nightmare. There is no chance to call a customer support to get a solution, the ground crew is badly trained and not allowed to take any decisions – they most probably will also try to call the same malfunctioning support. At the end you will pay for it to get any further. Not a good feeling even if at the end it still will be cheaper than a serious airline."
AE,"November 7, 2022",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,1,0,0,,1,0,No,"Never again… Booked upfront a flight with 4 nights in Venice, Wednesday (evening) to Sunday (morning). Reasonably cheap, alright. A couple of weeks before the outbound flight was postponed by 20 hours (!), meaning the trip became one day shorter. (BTW, they do not even bother to update you, it was the travel company which sent a note). But even this is not their ugliest record: on Friday get a message that the return flight is moved at 7am on *Saturday* instead of Sunday – 23 hours earlier (!) than planned! (And again – no message from WIZZ, just from the travel agent). Say what? Making the itinerary two days shorter?! Moving flight a day earlier a few hours before the new flight time?! With no rebook/refund/cancelation options?! I could not even imagine this is legal. (As a result I had to book another return flight) All this comes on top of constant flight delays and cancelations. WIZZ, you lost me (and hope you lose the business in favor of more honest companies)…"
Fadwa,"September 8, 2022",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,1,0,No,"Wizz air is not a reliable airlines. On 27th Aug 22, I drove from Dubai to Abudhabi to catch flight 5W7003, thinking that I have booked with a cost effective reliable scheduled airline, after reaching the airport waiting in the check in line for an hour I find from other passengers that the flight is cancelled, no representative from Wizz air to understand from what’s next. No one at the airport representing the airline and they advise to call the airlines, I called, and nevertheless that the lady I spoke to was on her nerves (as if she was a passenger) she advised she will process my cancellation of the whole flight (cant rely on a return with them) and send me a confirmation email. Refund would take 10 days, no confirmation was sent, and I am praying to god I would see a refund in 10 days, the flight cost was 3177 aed"
Jack,"September 8, 2022",Wizz,3.7,Flew Premium Economy Class,1.0,2,5,1,0,4,1,0,No,"We had an awful flight from start to finish!!! The stewardesses were absolutely nasty throughout the entire flight!! They locked the restroom for most of the flight claiming turbulence which none of us felt! They also did not allow the restrooms to be used every time they wanted to sell food or drinks so that the aisle would be clear for them! There was a terrible atmosphere on the plane the entire flight, and we couldn’t wait to get off!! Terrible Experience!!!"
Lukas,"July 26, 2022",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,9.0,5,4,5,0,5,5,0,Yes,"Excellent experience with WIZZ. The low-budget airline fullfilled all my expectations, which take the low price into account. I can recommend WIZZ (only 1 flight experience so far) for anyone who is okay with a delay of 1,5h and paying for water on the plane."
Sonia,"June 21, 2022",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,No,The airline offers cheap fares to lure in passengers but then makes every attempt to extract money from you. They even charge money to check-in at the airport. We had to pay a fee of 40 euros to check each of us in. Never heard of this. The staff is very rude. They even have a sign at check-in saying that unruly passengers may be denied service; have never seen this sign anywhere in the world and we travel quite a bit. Suspect it happens a lot. The boarding of the plane was horrible and felt like cattle being herded. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
David,"March 4, 2022",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,1.0,2,1,4,2,4,3,3,Yes,"Flew with Wizz 3 times, bought new tickets a couple hours ago. The service hasn’t changed in the last few years, it’s daylight robbery. Even though shown prices are usually really good, sometimes okayish, they tend to hike the price to twice the amount it was before. Which then makes it comparable to a national airlines, which include baggage and meal in the price, obviously a bigger legroom."
Ivan,"November 1, 2021",Wizz,3.7,Flew Economy Class,8.0,5,3,4,3,,3,3,Yes,"Good airline in overall. I flew 12 times with Wizz Air in 2020 and only twice in 2021 so far. Almost always I was satisfied with price (last time I paid less than 10 Euro), legroom is bad but even with my 190+ cm it does not feel too bad. Better than on some regular carriers. Seats are assigned in random order unless you pay. It is sad, however, that a lot of people had problems with Wizz Air. For example refund and so on. I got refund 5 times, once on bank account from Wizz Air due to A LOT OF cancelations in 2020 (I fly often). My advice is to accept on Wizz Account and than request to transfer them to the bank account. Service is OK for price you pay."
Allie,"January 31, 2020",Xiamen Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,0,1,0,,,0,No,"I am extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from this airline. I paid $748.00 to change the flight for me and my partner, because I was given the wrong date to return on. $400 of that fee was just for them to make the change. Shortly after making this payment they involuntarily changed the flight I had just paid to change. I was able to call and cancel my flights but they refused to give me the $400 back for the cost the to make the change, which they immediately changed which take away the point of paying $400 of a specific flight home that matches our schedule."
Luke,"July 27, 2018",Xiamen Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,1,2,1,1,,,0,No,"Xiamen Airlines Worst airline operating. Stole my money on the last flight. Denied boarding because of a smear on my passport then no refund. Pure profit. Should have known better. December 27th, 2017 Upon boarding a return flight from Manilla, Philippines the counter attendants did not check my bag. It was not on my flight. They also put me on a tranfer visa intead of a 24 hours or 7 days visa. So upon arrival at the layover in Xiamen I was rushed by China Security Inspection personnel. The airline manager tried to coerce me into taking guilt of their mistake. And at no time told me my bag wasn’t on the flight. Security Inspection asked the airline manager to leave and game a 7 day visa for my 25 hour layover. At the Xiamen Airlines international transfer desk, there was no English speaking service. They use a cellular phone and Google Translate. They absolutely cared less about assisting me and treated me like garbage. They refused me the complimentary hotel room because i was over 24 hours layover by 1 hour. Even though with my late arrival caused by their incompetecy i only had 23 hours. So I went to the atm and ripped out more cash than i should have needed too. Got a taxi to a hotel coincidentally Xiamen Airlines was booking the other transfer passengers into. Upon checking in they took a 100+- deposit and charged my credit card and equal amount. When i checked out at noon the next day the hotel refused to give back the cash. The wonderful Xiamen Airlines affiliate hotel likely would not charge my card because mastercard would take 2-4 percent. Worse the ATM’S outside the airport do not accept foreign cards so I had no money to pay a taxi to get 20 kilometers to the airport. The hotel owner laughed and said “It is not my problem. I don’t care. Haha” Luckily some canadians overheard the commotion and got me in their taxi. Upon arriving at the airport my checked luggage was not transferred. It was now, “unclaimed luggage,” because it didn’t arrive on my flight because of Xiamen Airlines incompetency. Upon trying to retrieve it with 10 minutes left to clear security for boarding the returning flight Xiamen Airlines manager called China Security Inspection to search my bag thoroughly. I told them to keep it which prompted, “just take it”. It made no sense since it was going through a complete screening right afterwards. Thanks Xiamen Airlines"
Rich,"June 24, 2018",Xiamen Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy Class,1.0,0,0,2,0,,,0,No,"I knew 8 hours ahead of time that my daughter and I would miss the flight from Los Angeles to Xiamen (then to Seoul) on June 2nd due to weather delaying her connecting flight, however I was unable to reach anyone at the airline to tell them and reschedule the flight. I called repeatedly and there was no response. We actually went to Los Angeles airport (LAX) to talk to them in person, but they only have staff there around the time of their one flight (at 12:15am). Finally a local Los Angeles representative named Lake responded to my email and he was helpful and responsive, but by then it was too late. We were considered a no-show and I had to spend another $2100 for two new tickets on another airline. He said they could rebook us, but we would pay a penalty and the difference in fare even though I had a delay certificate from American Airlines from the delayed flight. This added up to about the cost of new tickets. Also, we would have missed two more days of our trip until space was available on flights to Seoul. This airline may otherwise be fine, but I want to inform people of the risk of using them."
Wendale,"May 15, 2017",Xiamen Airlines,4.4,Flew Economy,9.0,4,5,5,0,,,5,Yes,"The plane was estimated to take off at 9:45 am, and we boarded the plane at about 9:20, then sat for one and a half hours until it took off but didn’t know the reason! Other than that, all was good. The luggage rack was lit up by the blue lights and the seats were all blue which made the flight enjoyable and pleasant. The young cabin crew were all friendly and attentive. And the food was delicious: pork/fish rice, bread with chili sauce, cake and yogurt. All in all, it was a satisfactory flight."
