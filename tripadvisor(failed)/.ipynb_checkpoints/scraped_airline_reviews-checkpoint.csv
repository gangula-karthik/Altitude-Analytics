Please be careful and do not buy. I contacted support, no help whatsoever from them. Not even the slightest approach from them. Be warned!",1,{}

I flew with Adria Airways last year on a round trip flight from Copenhagen to Ljubljana.  There was no problem as the flights to/from Ljubljana were on time.  This year my experience with Adria Airways was similar to most reviews listed on TripAdvisor.  I arrived 5:30am to catch my 7am flight from Ljubljana to Copenhagen.  This time the flight was cancelled.  And coincidently, upon arriving at the airport I get a text from Adria Airways informing me that the flight was cancelled.  I then waited 3 hours in line waiting to talk to Adria Airways passenger service.  Why 3 hours?  For some reason Adria Airways only had one person to deal with 100 or so upset/anxious passengers.  Adria Airways employees in the information booth and baggage check-in did not assist.Fortunately, I got a flight that day from Ljubljana to Copenhagen with a stopover in Munich.  Unfortunately, the flight was delayed several hours.  So overall I spent a total of 9 hours in the Ljubljana Airport.  Compensation for the cancelled flight and then delayed flight was free lunch.",3,"{'Legroom': 3, 'Seat comfort': 3, 'In-flight Entertainment': 2, 'Customer service': 4, 'Value for money': 3, 'Cleanliness': 3, 'Check-in and boarding': 2, 'Food and Beverage': 3}"

We waited at our gate, checked the monitor, and at boarding time realized that the gate had been moved.  We heard no announcements and hurried to the new gate.  All of our bags had to be checked or gate checked because the plane was so small.We were herded on to a bus after walking down a flight of stairs. We stood on the bus for some time until the bus driver drove us to the small plane.  We had to put our gate checked bags on a cart and wait our turn to get on the tiny airplane.  The flight was short and when we arrived, we waited for our gate checked baggage, collected it, and boarded another bus to get to the terminal.This airline was the only one that could get us to our destination in a short period of time, but it wasnâ€™t a pleasant experience",2,"{'Legroom': 2, 'Seat comfort': 3, 'In-flight Entertainment': 1, 'Customer service': 2, 'Value for money': 2, 'Cleanliness': 2, 'Check-in and boarding': 1}"
